Chapter 12: The Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady (Part 3)
Lan Shengmei and He Yizhou are dating!!!
Really, Lan Shengmei personally confirmed their relationship!!!
It all started when An Cui suddenly got up during the third class break in the afternoon and walked straight to Class 2 next door, heading directly towards He Yizhou, who was chatting and laughing with his classmates.
The entire class fell silent, and a large crowd of onlookers in the hallway curiously watched the scene unfold.
An Cui asked him, “I heard that you like me?”
He Yizhou’s expression froze. He never expected her to come over so directly and ask this in front of so many people. If he said he didn’t like her, those girls would swarm around him again. If he said he did, who knew what this Lan Shengmei—who supposedly went mad this morning and stuffed a dead rat into someone’s mouth—would do next?
“What? Could it be that you were just using me as a shield?” An Cui’s lips curled into an arrogant yet insincere smile, looking dangerously unpredictable.
“No…” He Yizhou forced a gentle yet sorrowful smile. “This is my own business, please don’t mind it.”
It sounded as if he was saying, Whether I like you or not is my own concern, you don’t need to care. A vague, ambiguous answer.
However, An Cui simply nodded. “So, you’re really secretly in love with me, huh?”
He Yizhou: “……”
“Alright, from today on, you’re my boyfriend.”
He Yizhou: “……”
An Cui: “Don’t forget to line up for my lunch at noon. I want sweet and sour pork ribs.”
He Yizhou: “……”
At noon, An Cui went to the cafeteria with her newly acquired boyfriend by coercion. She sent him off to get her food while she went to find a seat.
After this morning’s incident, An Cui’s name had spread throughout the entire First High School. News of her true identity as the young lady of the Lan family had also circulated. The moment she entered the cafeteria, the students all turned to look at her, even those on the second floor peering down from the railing.
The second floor was noticeably less crowded and much quieter. As in every noble school depicted in novels, First High also had a designated VIP area. The second floor was reserved for the few students from prestigious families, and ordinary students who weren’t part of that circle were not allowed to enter.
Although Lan Shengmei’s family background qualified her to be there, she had always stayed away from the school’s aristocratic social circles. Moreover, she had a down-to-earth personality and disliked privilege, so she had never set foot on the second floor.
An Cui, however, was different. If she had privileges, why not use them? Just like how she had no qualms about whipping Lan Shuhua—because she knew that her grandparents were biased toward her, and even if she hit Lan Shuhua, there would be no consequences.
So, An Cui went upstairs. The central group on the second floor, who had been laughing and chatting, all turned to look at her. Among them was Lan Shuhua, since most of the students from the wealthiest families happened to be in the first-year cohort. When Lan Shuhua saw An Cui, her face immediately turned sour.
The seating on the second floor was also different. Those in the central circle sat on plush, comfortable sofas, while the other tables had regular cushioned chairs. Clearly, the second floor had its own hierarchy as well.
An Cui, determined to stay in character as an arrogant, self-centered young lady, was not about to settle for less. She walked straight toward the central group.
Lan Shuhua was furious. “What are you doing here?”
Ignoring her, An Cui’s gaze landed on a boy, and she naturally commanded, “Move.”
The boy’s family background wasn’t as strong as the Lan family’s, but he was clearly smooth in social situations. Without hesitation, he stood up and fawningly said, “Miss, please have a seat! What brings you up here today?”
An Cui neither sat down nor acknowledged his words. Instead, her gaze swept across the others sitting on the long sofa. They looked a little embarrassed at first but, under her stare, hesitantly stood up one by one.
Only then did An Cui sit down, claiming the entire long sofa for herself, making it clear that no one else was allowed to sit there.
Then she finally responded to the initial question, “I felt like coming up here, so I did. What? I’m not allowed?”
“Lan Shengmei, what’s wrong with you? Do you even know anyone here? Isn’t this awkward for you?” Lan Shuhua shouted.
An Cui raised her eyelashes slightly, casting a cold glance at her. “Do you want another whipping?”
Lan Shuhua’s face turned all shades of red and green. “T-That doesn’t mean you can be so domineering! Why won’t you let anyone else sit?”
“I don’t like sharing a sofa with others,” An Cui stated matter-of-factly, her lips curling into a smirk that was both arrogant and mischievous, making her seem downright wicked.
She turned to the students around her and said, “Don’t mind me. I’m just here to eat. You can keep chatting, just don’t be too loud. If my presence bothers you, move elsewhere. Be good, don’t make me waste my breath.”
“An Ran, look at this…” Lan Shuhua and the others turned to their leader, An Ran. As the only young master who could rival the Lan family’s eldest daughter, he was their last hope.
An Ran was lounging in a single-seat sofa, sipping bubble tea. Under the expectant gazes of his peers, he simply said, “Since she said so, just listen.”
With An Ran’s words, what else could they do? Besides, he clearly wasn’t planning to move, so they had no choice but to endure. The previously cheerful and lively dining table fell into complete silence.
When He Yizhou arrived with An Cui’s lunch, he was met with the sight of her sitting like a queen on the long sofa, while the once-arrogant school elites were squeezed together on another sofa, looking utterly miserable—like a group of poor souls being bullied by a tyrant.
He Yizhou: “……” Why did he suddenly feel a sense of balance in his heart?
An Cui, who had refused to let anyone else sit beside her, made an exception for her boyfriend in name but servant in reality, granting him a seat next to her.
An Ran glanced up at He Yizhou, then at An Cui, who was elegantly eating her meal. He frowned slightly and muttered under his breath, “Tsk.”
Fully embracing her new persona as an arrogant and domineering young lady, An Cui was wreaking havoc wherever she went. In just a few days, she had become the number one school bully. Only An Ran in the first year could stand against her. The students all believed that An Cui had been deeply affected by the private child scandal, leading to her rebellious transformation. She was no longer the gentle and approachable young lady of the past. Anyone who dared provoke her had better be prepared to be crushed.
And at that moment, her father finally returned—with the male lead, Lan Shengzhe.

============


Chapter 13: The Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady (Part 4)
When the butler informed her that her father had returned with his illegitimate son, An Cui was riding her horse. Recently, she had become quite enamored with equestrian sports, and the black stallion, Caesar, had become her new favorite. Originally a purebred racehorse purchased by her third uncle from England, he had gifted it to An Cui the moment he saw how much she liked it. From that day on, Caesar became her exclusive mount—no one else in the family was allowed to ride him.
“I understand,” An Cui responded to the butler, but instead of heading to the front hall to meet her father and half-brother, she cracked the whip and urged Caesar into another gallop, showing no intention of changing course.
The butler sighed and returned to the front hall to report to the master and madam of the house. The two elderly figures, who doted on their eldest granddaughter, could only sigh in turn and wave their hands dismissively. "Forget it, forget it," they said. Their beloved granddaughter had grown rebellious—but at least she hadn’t abandoned her studies like those delinquent girls who ran wild all day. In their eyes, their sweet, kind granddaughter merely had a bit of a temper and liked to push people around sometimes. But to them, she remained as affectionate as ever and was still someone worth cherishing.
However, the warmth in their gazes turned cold and indifferent when they looked at the frail young boy before them.
Lan Shengzhe was two years younger than An Cui, which made him fifteen—the same age as Lan Shuhua. Before being brought to the Lan family, he had lived a harsh life with his mother. After her death, he was sent to live under someone else’s roof, where he endured hunger, hard labor, and malnourishment. As a result, he was unusually thin and even shorter than most boys his age.
Now, the frail boy in his faded clothes stood in the opulent hall, surrounded by people dressed in luxurious silks, exuding an air and presence utterly different from his own. He could feel their scrutiny—none of it particularly friendly. Nervously, he clenched his hands, his eyes filled with timidity and harmlessness.
"He does look rather handsome," Lan Shuhua commented after sizing him up for a while. "No wonder his mother managed to be a mistress." She had come with her parents to watch the spectacle, but it was a shame An Cui wasn’t here. She would have loved to see her reaction.
Her voice was loud and clear, ensuring that Lan Shengzhe heard every word. The boy lowered his head in humiliation.
"Alright, we’ve seen him now," the grandmother said. "Butler, take him to his room. Let him wash up and change his clothes."
"Yes, madam. This way, Young Master Shengzhe."
The butler led Lan Shengzhe upstairs.
"Mom, is he Sister Shengmei’s brother?"
"Sort of."
"Then should I respect him the way I respect Sister Shengmei?"
"What nonsense! He’s just an illegitimate child. Why would you need to respect him?"
"…Oh."
Lan Shengzhe listened to their conversation behind him—voices that made no effort to lower in his presence. He dropped his head, his too-long bangs casting a shadow over his eyes, concealing the storm of resentment brewing within them.
Illegitimate child… Illegitimate child…
So what? Who was the one responsible for his mother’s pregnancy? He had never wanted to return. His mother had taken him far away, but some people were determined to push them to the brink. He still remembered how that hypocritical woman had come to see his mother years ago—and how his mother had sobbed so desperately afterward.
He would have his revenge. Everything they owed him and his mother—he would take it all back.
It was a pity, really. That woman had died a year ago.
But that was fine.
She had left behind a daughter.
Lan Shengmei.
The room he was given was merely a guest room, far smaller than any of the main bedrooms. After changing into clean clothes, he heard a servant call for him.
"The young lady has asked for you in the back courtyard."
Here it comes. Lan Shengzhe thought to himself. He had heard that this girl resembled his mother. If that were true, then she was likely just as hypocritical—speaking softly with a gentle smile, all the while sinking daggers into people’s hearts.
He followed the servant to the back courtyard.
It was vast—so vast that standing there, one couldn’t see the end of the greenery. Lush grass stretched endlessly, interspersed with vibrant flower beds in full bloom.
He waited there for a long time, but An Cui did not appear. He remained expressionless, but inwardly, he sneered.
See? It had begun. She was making him wait as a show of dominance.
Then came the distant sound of galloping hooves.
Lan Shengzhe looked up. A lone rider on horseback was approaching rapidly.
The thundering hooves kicked up dirt, each impact crisp and powerful. The black stallion was magnificent, and the rider sat astride it with perfect ease. She held the reins firmly, her body lifting slightly off the saddle in a poised, professional stance. She looked elegant and untamed, exuding an effortless charm.
She was charging straight at him.
Even as the horse closed the distance, she did not slow down.
Lan Shengzhe’s eyes widened. The massive steed loomed larger and larger in his vision until he could no longer take in its full form. His body locked up, frozen in place.
Just as he braced himself for the impact, the rider suddenly yanked the reins.
The stallion reared up on its powerful hind legs, whinnying sharply. Its hooves struck the air inches from him before landing with a practiced sidestep, coming to a halt at his side.
Lan Shengzhe felt his knees weaken, but he forced himself to remain standing, refusing to collapse in disgrace.
The towering horse cast a long shadow over him, forcing him to crane his neck to see the rider’s face.
And so he looked up—only to meet a pair of eyes gazing down at him with casual scrutiny.
Her eyes were strikingly beautiful—pure black, sharp, and filled with arrogance and indifference, with just a flicker of curiosity. It was the look of a child who had momentarily taken interest in an ant on the ground—something so insignificant it wasn’t even worth crushing.
His heart clenched. For a moment, the world seemed to shrink, leaving only this small space between them. His ears rang with silence.
Then, from those vivid red lips, came a single remark:
"Not much to look at."
There wasn’t even a trace of mockery—just an indifferent dismissal, making it all the more humiliating.
Having seen all she needed to see, An Cui turned her horse and rode away.
Lan Shengzhe stood there for a few seconds before it truly sank in.
That woman… That was Lan Shengmei?
She was nothing like he had imagined. Not the slightest trace of hypocrisy. She had made no effort to conceal her contempt for him.
His hands clenched into fists. He glared after her retreating figure, his heart burning with hatred.
Someday… he would make her regret this.
Back in his room, his phone rang.
Seeing the caller ID, the darkness in his eyes eased slightly.
"Baoli."
"Ah Zhe, are you at the Lan family now? How is it? Are they treating you badly?" A sweet, melodious voice rang out from the other end—it was Shu Baoli, his childhood friend. Their fates were eerily similar: both raised by single mothers, both ostracized in their hometown. They had been each other’s solace. Shu Baoli had been taken back to her own family a year earlier, but they had never lost contact. She had even sent him snacks. Upon hearing that the Lan family was bringing him back, she had been more excited than he was.
"I’m here. It’s exactly as I expected… except Lan Shengmei is different from what I imagined."
"Is she difficult to deal with?"
"Maybe. I need to observe her more," he said. She was undoubtedly spoiled, but perhaps she was just a brainless fool.
"Don’t worry, I’ll help you. The Lan family all go to First High, right? You’ll be attending there too. I’ll transfer over—we can be together again!" Shu Baoli said excitedly.
Lan Shengzhe felt a warmth spread in his heart. "Alright. I’ll be waiting for you."
Together, they would take back everything that was stolen from them.

Chapter 14: The Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady (Part 5)
However, before a great destiny befalls a person, they must first endure hardships and suffering. Before the male protagonist could truly become the protagonist, he had a long and arduous journey to endure.
In the original novel, although Lan Shengmei initially couldn't accept the fact that her father was a scoundrel, upon meeting Lan Shengzhe, her saintly compassion overwhelmed her. She saw him as innocent, was deceived by his timid and harmless demeanor, and constantly helped him. As a result, others restrained their bullying of him. However, this time, An Cui completely ignored him, and naturally, the severity of the bullying from others differed from the original story.
One time, a maid serving at the dining table deliberately ignored Lan Shengzhe's request for a spoon in front of An Cui. Coldly, An Cui spoke up:
"What? Did your employer cut your wages, or have you lost all sense of fear? Lan Shengzhe may be an unwelcome illegitimate child, but it's not your place to discipline him."
The maid panicked, immediately apologized, and begged for forgiveness but was still fired. After this incident, no one dared to openly humiliate Lan Shengzhe again, but the bullying simply moved into the shadows, and in some cases, even intensified.
Servants stole his clothes, ate his snacks, and called him a bastard behind his back. The adults of the Lan family ignored him, and his peers ridiculed him and treated him like a servant. He endured humiliation, perfecting the art of feigning harmlessness.
System 524: "...Cui Cui, with the amount of hatred points the male protagonist is accumulating, I fear you’ll end up with no grave to be buried in."
It really wanted to shake An Cui by the shoulders—could she not treat the male lead a little better?! Where was the romance arc?! Why was she not trying to win him over?! Did she really intend for this so-called "romance" to be about his hatred instead of love?!
An Cui picked at her nails and blew on them: "I’m rather curious about what it feels like to have no grave to be buried in."
System 524 realized she was serious and suddenly remembered—oh right, she was a lunatic... Forget it. Let her be.
Lan Shengzhe was locked in the attic. In the dust-filled air, a beam of moonlight streamed through the skylight. He gritted his teeth in hatred, the metallic taste of blood spreading in his mouth.
He recalled everything that had happened over the past few days, remembering An Cui’s arrogant posture. He couldn’t help but wonder—did she know about the things happening to him in secret? Or was she the one orchestrating them? No, she wasn’t the type to do such things. She never hid her dislike for him, but she had also defended him before, which meant that while she despised him, she wouldn’t allow just anyone to bully him. After all, nominally, they were still siblings…
If not for this, why else would they have to sneak around behind her back to torment him?
She simply didn’t think he was worth bothering with. To her, he was nothing, so she wouldn’t waste her energy targeting him.
Thinking this, the taste of blood in his mouth grew stronger. He felt a deep anger, but he had to stay calm—he had to think carefully about how to survive in this situation and achieve his future goals.
The next morning, when An Cui opened her door, she saw Lan Shengzhe standing outside. Seeing her, a hint of youthful embarrassment and humiliation flashed across his face as he eagerly took her schoolbag from her hands.
An Cui narrowed her eyes slightly at him but said nothing as she walked downstairs.
Lan Shengzhe followed her obediently, carrying her bag.
System 524: ?????
Lan Shengzhe tried his best to please An Cui, but there was only so much he could do, as she was in school every day, and no one in the Lan family had mentioned anything about him attending school.
The boy was exceptionally handsome, and his suffering was evident. The occasional glimpses of his shame, silent endurance, and humiliation naturally invoked sympathy from others.
One evening, as the sun was setting, An Cui galloped back on horseback. Seeing the boy still standing in the same place as before, she dismounted, and he immediately ran up to her, silently taking the reins and tending to her horse.
He was incredibly adaptable and had perfectly grasped An Cui’s temperament. He knew that empty words wouldn’t win her favor—she wasn’t someone easily deceived. Instead, it was better to be direct about his intentions. This way, she might find him interesting and test his limits, giving him the opportunity he needed.
An Cui: "Why are you trying so hard to please me? What do you want?"
Lan Shengzhe: "I want to go to school."
An Cui smirked: "Sure." She looked down at him with a condescending gaze. "You’ll be responsible for taking care of my horse, Caesar. Feeding, cleaning, shoveling manure—you’ll do everything yourself. When I’m satisfied, you can go to school."
Making a rich young master do a stable hand’s work—it was humiliating, but compared to the other forms of humiliation he had suffered, this one was almost merciful.
Seeing a glimmer of hope, Lan Shengzhe’s heart ignited with determination. Every morning after breakfast, he went to the stables to learn how to care for the horses. The stable hands bullied him, forcing him to tend to the other horses as well, refusing to teach him otherwise. He endured it all—wearing rubber boots, an apron, and sleeves, shoveling manure, and putting up with the stench of the stables, exhausting himself daily.
One day, two days, three days… Five days passed.
One morning, just as An Cui returned from school, she was told—Caesar was dead.
She rushed to the stable, where the black stallion lay motionless on the ground. The veterinarian stood by helplessly, while Lan Shengzhe looked pale. Several other family members stood around, smirking at the spectacle.
An Cui knelt beside the horse, running a hand over its mane. Its body was cold. "What happened?"
Veterinarian: "Preliminary examination suggests food poisoning."
The stable hands immediately spoke up: "For the past few days, young master Shengzhe has been responsible for Caesar’s care and feeding…"
An Cui stood up. The fury in her eyes made everyone tremble, but all she said was: "Bring me my whip."
They quickly obeyed, handing her the whip she normally used for riding.
She took it and, without hesitation, lashed it down hard.
"Snap!"
The whip cracked in the air before striking Lan Shengzhe, leaving an immediate red welt on his neck.
He stared at An Cui, shock and disbelief flashing in his eyes, quickly replaced by anger and hatred. She should have known! She wasn’t stupid! It was obvious he had been framed! But she didn’t hesitate to blame him!
"Snap!" "Snap!" "Snap!"
The whip fell mercilessly, again and again. The boy stood motionless, stubbornly glaring at her, while she, expressionless and furious, showed no mercy.
By the time she stopped, her arms were tired. The elders arrived and, seeing Lan Shengzhe’s battered state, didn’t even glance at him.
"It’s just a horse, no need to get so angry, Xiaomei. Does your hand hurt?" "We’ll buy you another one, just like Caesar." "Don’t be mad, dear, it’s bad for your health…"
An Cui was gently coaxed away, while Lan Shengzhe, trembling from pain, clenched his fists and lowered his eyes.
That night, he extracted the truth and brought it to An Cui.
The next day, the culprits were fired and sued for compensation.
At the same time, Lan Shengzhe was finally allowed to attend school.


========================


Chapter 15: The Arrogant Young Lady (Part 6)
Lan Shengzhe stared at An Cui’s tightly shut door, panting a few times before his chest gradually calmed down.
He returned to his room, and not long after, a servant brought him some ointment. Holding the ointment, he sat motionless in his chair, lost in thought. It hurt—his whole body ached. Every wound, whether hidden beneath his clothes or exposed, burned intensely. When he closed his eyes, all he could see were An Cui’s cold and furious eyes, and the merciless whip that lashed down upon him, making every nerve in his body tremble violently.
His phone rang—not a call, but a video invitation. It was from Shu Baoli.
Lan Shengzhe snapped back to reality and instinctively answered the call. Only after picking up did he realize his current disheveled state, but it was already too late—Shu Baoli had already started shouting.
"Ah Zhe!!! This is outrageous! They actually hit you?!" On the other end of the call, Shu Baoli glared furiously at the whip marks on Lan Shengzhe’s face and neck.
Lan Shengzhe was silent for two seconds before responding with a faint "Mm."
"Who did it? Lan Shengmei?"
"Mm... She was furious because the horse I was raising was poisoned to death."
"She even made you take care of her horse?!" Shu Baoli became even more enraged. "She’s humiliating you! Making you do a servant’s job—so what if you’re an illegitimate child? Is it your fault? What right does she have to treat you like this? Just because she’s legitimate, she thinks she’s superior?! The law says legitimate and illegitimate children have the same rights! She has no right to treat you this way!"
Seeing Shu Baoli stand up for him so fiercely, Lan Shengzhe’s eyes softened a little. "At least the issue of me going to school should be resolved."
"You even have to please Lan Shengmei just to go to school?! The Lan family is too much. Ah Zhe, I’ll help you. I’ve already convinced my mom—I’ll be transferring to No.1 High School in a few days. Then we’ll make Lan Shengmei pay!" A hint of malice appeared on Shu Baoli’s otherwise adorable face.
Meanwhile, An Cui was lying comfortably in bed when 524 reminded her: "Based on the current plot trajectory, I think the male lead, after being humiliated like this, is probably plotting revenge with the villainous supporting female character."
"Oh."
"...Can you at least acknowledge her intelligence? She’s still a scheming villainess, you know???"
An Cui happily replied: "Then let’s see who’s more villainous."
524: "..." Completely speechless. This host refuses to be the heroine and insists on competing with the villainess for her role—what kind of bizarre streamer is this???
The next day, the two servants were fired and sued for damages. The purebred racehorse imported from the UK was worth a fortune—enough to make those two audacious fools cry their hearts out.
At the same time, Lan Shengzhe was finally allowed to attend No.1 High School.
...
He Yizhou had been feeling complicated about going to school lately, and the reason was undoubtedly An Cui. Ever since she forced him into this relationship, he had indeed gotten rid of his many annoying admirers. Now, in all of No.1 High School, who would dare send a love letter to the boyfriend of the school’s tyrannical queen? The effect was the same as when he had originally lied about liking Lan Shengmei. But why did he feel so conflicted?
Ultimately, apart from being forced into this, the biggest reason was...
"He Yizhou, what are you doing? Class is over—why haven’t you gone to the cafeteria yet? If you’re late, my sweet and sour ribs will be gone." After the fourth period, before he could move, An Cui impatiently urged him.
He Yizhou: "There’s no sweet and sour ribs today."
"Did I not tell you? I’ve already arranged with the school to have sweet and sour ribs at every meal from now on."
He Yizhou: "..."
"Why are you still standing there? Go queue up." Arms crossed, brows furrowed—clearly, she could go herself, yet she insisted on ordering him around. The way she stood there so arrogantly, as if it was only natural, was the perfect embodiment of every spoiled and detestable villainess in a novel.
He Yizhou swallowed the frustrated breath stuck in his throat, gritting his teeth slightly. "…Fine, fine. But, Missy, since you can decide what dishes the cafeteria serves, why not just have them set aside a portion for you?"
"Hm? If they did that, what would I need a boyfriend for?"
??? Right, why did she even need a boyfriend? Just to boss me around???
Frustrated, furious, and yet he still had to line up to get food for the young lady. Meanwhile, she casually strolled upstairs, waiting for her so-called "boyfriend"—more like a personal servant—to serve her.
No, he had to break up. Why should he be her errand boy? So many girls liked him—compared to An Cui, they were all sweet and gentle. They wouldn’t even think of making him serve them; instead, they’d eagerly pamper him!
Just as he was thinking this, his phone buzzed with a new message:
From: Annoying Young Lady "Bring me a bottle of lemon juice."
A vein twitched on He Yizhou’s forehead. Lemon juice… There’s a vending machine on the second floor, just a few steps away!!! Are you some kind of mermaid princess? Will walking a few steps kill you???
He Yizhou felt his carefully maintained persona teetering on the edge of collapse under An Cui’s cold-blooded, shameless oppression. He was supposed to be the type who was warm on the outside but detached on the inside, always watching the world with cold amusement. The happier he smiled, the more indifferent he truly was. Yet now, he was on the verge of becoming completely transparent—he was furious inside and out!
He had to break up. But this woman had gone completely mad ever since entering her rebellious phase. He needed to be careful—senior year was too important, and he couldn’t let her ruin his chances of getting into a prestigious university. He had to find the perfect opportunity.
As he strategized his breakup, he grabbed two trays of food and went upstairs. As always, An Cui occupied an entire long sofa by herself, while An Ran’s group sat awkwardly—some crammed onto one sofa, others dragging chairs from nearby tables. They spoke in hushed voices, looking utterly oppressed.
It was obvious—though An Cui’s presence had disrupted their group dynamic, none of them dared to leave because one person refused to move.
He Yizhou glanced at An Ran, who was curled up on the sofa sipping milk tea. With his fair and delicate features, he looked sweet and obedient—but He Yizhou knew better. This boy, raised in a military family, was anything but gentle.
"Lemon juice." An Cui ordered as soon as the food arrived.
Suppressing his irritation, He Yizhou walked toward the vending machine.
"Senior, do you want to try some milk tea?" An Ran suddenly asked, his voice slow and playful.
An Cui raised an eyebrow. "Too sweet."
"This one isn’t very sweet, and the pearls are nice and chewy. It’s fun to eat."
A smirk tugged at An Cui’s lips. "Are you a child?"
Pouting slightly, An Ran replied, "I’m still a baby. Please be mindful of my fragile heart. You can call me a baby, but don’t call me a child. So, will you try the milk tea I’m offering?"
An Cui, amused by his cuteness, relented. "Fine. But if it’s bad, I won’t spare you just because you’re pretty."
He Yizhou: "..."
And so, the "servant" had no choice but to obediently fetch the lemon juice.

An Ran said, "Then I'll bring a cup for you too, Senior Sister, tomorrow at noon."
An Cui responded indifferently, neither agreeing nor refusing.
Meanwhile, across from them, An Ran's friends sat frozen, clutching their bowls in stunned silence, staring at An Ran and An Cui as if they had seen a ghost.
Lan Shuhua, feeling a twinge of jealousy, muttered, "It seems Cousin’s mood hasn’t been affected at all. And here I was, worried that she would completely change because of that illegitimate child. When he returns, you’ll be even angrier, won’t you? Looks like I was overthinking it."
"Can’t your food keep that mouth of yours shut if you have nothing pleasant to say?" An Cui lifted her lashes slightly, her gaze cool as she looked at Lan Shuhua.
Lan Shuhua... immediately shrank back in fear.
Even Lan Shuhua, a member of the family, was afraid of her. It was clear that An Cui was a force to be reckoned with at home. He Yizhou thought so, further solidifying his determination to find a way to sever ties with An Cui—cleanly and without complications.
While he searched for a solution, Lan Shengzhe enrolled in school.
Early that morning, he waited outside An Cui’s door. As soon as she stepped out, he silently reached out to take her backpack and followed behind her downstairs.
After breakfast with An Cui, he picked up her bag again and trailed behind her into the car.
Everyone who saw his submissive, servile demeanor wore open expressions of ridicule and disdain. But he remained indifferent, merely ensuring that, whenever An Cui glanced his way, he displayed just the right amount of silent endurance, shame, and humiliation—never revealing the depth of his scheming, never giving her a reason to be wary of him.
He endured. Life was long, and fate was ever-changing. He would remember every insult, every mockery. One day, when his wings were fully spread, he would return every humiliation in kind.
For now, he was just an ant, easily crushed, forced to swallow his pride and bide his time.



===================




Chapter 16: The Arrogant and Overbearing Young Lady (7)
Lan Shengzhe followed An Cui all the way, helping her carry her schoolbag. He accompanied her to the senior year classrooms, placed her bag on her desk, and then went to report to the first-year class.
An Cui was the focus of the entire school. When the unfamiliar boy, Lan Shengzhe, appeared following An Cui, it immediately caught the curiosity of the gossiping crowd. It soon spread that the mysterious young man was the illegitimate son who had caused An Cui's personality change.
"How shameless! An illegitimate son, always trailing behind the legitimate child. Is he begging for forgiveness?"
"He must be afraid of being bullied, that's why he's trying to please. Such thick skin."
"Isn't Lan Shengmei supposed to have a bad temper? Why is she so generous, letting him follow her around?"
"......"
Lan Shengzhe paid no attention to these discussions.
The school arranged classes based on academic performance, so Lan Shengzhe, being a transfer student with no grades, had to join the lowest class of the first year, along with Shu Baoli.
As soon as they saw each other, both suppressed their inner joy. They had already discussed it, so they didn't give away any signs of familiarity. Lan Shengzhe remained quiet, and no one was willing to be friends with him. Shu Baoli, on the other hand, was proactive and enthusiastic in integrating into the class. With her cute and sweet looks, and her lively and cheerful personality, she quickly made friends.
From them, she learned some things about An Cui and also heard how they mocked and made fun of Lan Shengzhe. Shu Baoli was so skilled at acting that she didn’t show any displeasure. She only sent messages to Lan Shengzhe during her free time.
Shu Baoli: "You told me not to speak for you, but how long should I endure? I'm about to explode!"
Lan Shengzhe: "Just a few more days. My situation is difficult, and sometimes, a little patience is needed for the bigger picture."
Shu Baoli: "Got it."
Though Lan Shengzhe asked Shu Baoli not to speak for him, it didn’t stop her from making trouble for An Cui. According to the rumors, An Cui was nothing but an arrogant and overbearing young lady. She wasn’t well-liked, and there were many people who disliked her, which showed her lack of emotional intelligence. Dealing with someone like her would be easy. The only problem was that they weren’t in the same grade.
But no opportunity? Then create one.
Shu Baoli found out that An Cui had joined the girls' volleyball club, so she joined as well.
...
In the fourth period that afternoon, when the class ended, An Cui came out of the classroom and saw Lan Shengzhe standing outside. She didn’t know when he had arrived.
An Cui ignored him, and he just followed her.
When they entered the cafeteria, Lan Shengzhe glanced at the queue and asked, "What do you want to eat?"
"No need," An Cui said faintly and walked straight to the second floor.
By the time Lan Shengzhe finished getting his meal and followed her upstairs, An Cui was already eating. She was sitting next to a young man who seemed somewhat special, as he was the only one sitting next to her.
As soon as Lan Shengzhe approached, Lan Shuhua angrily shouted at him, "Go away, is this your place? Get lost, you stink."
Lan Shengzhe's gaze fixed on Lan Shuhua for two seconds. When Lan Shuhua felt a little unnerved, he shifted his gaze and surveyed the second floor, quickly understanding the situation. He then silently went downstairs.
He was a little curious about who He Yizhou was, but he didn’t dare ask anyone, as everyone avoided him like the plague. It was clear they wouldn’t answer his questions.
After An Cui finished her lunch and she and He Yizhou went downstairs, he followed again. When He Yizhou returned to his class, Lan Shengzhe asked her, "Was that person your boyfriend?"
He just wanted an answer, and didn’t actually think He Yizhou was An Cui’s boyfriend.
"Yes," An Cui replied.
Lan Shengzhe was stunned for a moment and then frowned. He began to observe He Yizhou, trying to figure out why he had become An Cui's boyfriend.
He Yizhou was handsome, but there were many good-looking people in this world; his grades were excellent, but there were plenty of others with good grades—anything a person with average intelligence and hard work could achieve; his family was somewhat wealthy, but still far below the Lan family; his temperament was gentle, but there were plenty of people with better temperaments than He Yizhou.
So, what did An Cui see in him? Was it because he was fast at getting food in line and the aunt gave him extra servings?
...
The school was an elite one, and it was a famous setting in a romance novel that spanned millions of words, so it had its unique features. For example, the sports clubs were well-known. It was said that a certain NBA basketball star had been a student there. He had joined the basketball club and was spotted by scouts in his senior year, eventually entering the NBA instead of going to college, beginning his professional basketball career. Many professionals came to the school’s various sports clubs to scout for talent.
After Caesar's death, An Cui lost interest in horseback riding and took up volleyball. She had never played volleyball before, so she joined the girls' volleyball club just to try it out.
Although she was a scientist, she had excellent athletic ability. She couldn’t say she was instantly good at it, but she quickly got the hang of it.
When Shu Baoli joined, An Cui took a good look at her. Shu Baoli was a key character who had given the female protagonist, Lan Shengmei, a lot of trouble. She was an illegitimate child, but unlike Lan Shengzhe, whose mother had an accidental affair with the female protagonist’s father, her mother had been kept as a mistress and had worked hard to ruin the original wife, eventually succeeding.
Because they were both the daughters of mistresses, Shu Baoli and her mother were looked down upon in their small town, and no other children wanted to be friends with them. Lan Shengzhe’s situation was similar, so it was natural that they became friends.
Shu Baoli had liked Lan Shengzhe for a long time, so in the early stages, she kept making trouble for Lan Shengmei, causing her a lot of suffering. Once, she even schemed to nearly get Lan Shengmei assaulted. If Lan Shengzhe hadn’t learned about it and had a conscience, Lan Shengmei’s life would have been ruined.
However, the shock from that incident made Lan Shengmei sick, which led to her poor performance in the college entrance exams. Unable to get into a good university based on her abilities, she used money to get into a prestigious university, which led to her being criticized for it.
After student life ended, in the future adult world, she would be the cause of the constant misunderstandings between Lan Shengmei and Lan Shengzhe. Things like falling down stairs and car accidents would all be because of her, while the male protagonist would constantly forgive and let her go due to their childhood friendship.
This malicious female character sparked all the hatred in the story, making readers despise her. It was because of her that Lan Shengmei was called brainless by so many readers, even though she eventually ended up with the male protagonist.
She looked sweet and innocent, but who could have imagined her heart was so dark?
After observing her, An Cui lost interest and looked away. She walked towards the sidelines. There were only a few people scattered in the audience seats, and both Lan Shengzhe and He Yizhou, An Cui's "boyfriend," were present. Strangely, An Ran and his friends were also there.
The girl in the blue and white volleyball uniform revealed her fair, long legs. Her long hair was tied up in a high ponytail, showing her beautiful, confident face. This outfit was much more youthful and energetic than the usual school uniform, though it seemed a bit more aggressive.
An Cui reached out for a towel.
He Yizhou, holding back, silently handed her the towel. An Cui wiped her sweat, then took a couple of sips of sports drink, throwing both the water and towel back to him.
Shu Baoli approached the volleyball club president and said something. The president nodded in agreement.
"Girls, gather up," the volleyball club president, Jiang Qin, clapped her hands.
The girls from the volleyball club gathered.
"Training like this is a bit boring. Recently, we’ve had some new members, and the fastest way to get them to mesh and improve is to have some competition. So, we’ll divide into teams and have a little match."
No one objected. The competition would add fun, and it sounded great.
Soon, the teams were formed, and An Cui and Shu Baoli ended up in opposing teams.
The two teams quickly entered the arena. On the sandy court, separated by a net, Shu Baoli looked at An Cui, a trace of malice flashing in her eyes.
"Beep!" The whistle for the start of the match blew, and the ball was hit up by the girls' hands, passed along, and smacked towards the opposing team. Everything seemed harmonious and normal. But then, the girl who had been clumsy earlier, looking like a beginner, suddenly and unexpectedly stepped in front of the girl who was supposed to receive the ball, jumping up and slamming the ball towards the opposite side.
The event happened too quickly, catching everyone off guard. The ball thudded loudly and directly hit An Cui in the face. Despite her quick reaction, she was a step too slow, and the ball hit her forehead.



==================================

Chapter 17: The Arrogant and Overbearing Young Lady (Part 8)
The volleyball club members on the court were shocked. In the audience, An Ran let out a loud "What the hell!" as she abruptly shifted from her lazy posture, almost jumping up. He Yizhou dropped both his towel and water bottle to the ground, while Lan Shengzhe's eyes widened suddenly, his heart skipping a beat.
“Oh! I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, senior! I-I-I didn’t mean to…” Shu Baoli was so startled that her face turned pale. She quickly ran over to apologize to An Cui, though in her heart, she regretted not hitting An Cui square in the face. It would have been even better if she had made her nose bleed!
524 was furious: 【That was definitely on purpose! This vicious supporting character!!】
An Cui stood still, rubbing her forehead. She was sure there must be a red mark there.
"Are you okay, Sheng Mei?"
"Are you alright?"
Others also gathered around with concern, though deep down, they thought the new girl was just plain unlucky. She had just transferred in and already managed to provoke this domineering young lady. Still, they couldn’t help but secretly enjoy the spectacle—seeing the usually arrogant and high-and-mighty An Cui getting hit in the face with a ball was incredibly satisfying. Let’s see how she keeps up that air of superiority now.
"I'm fine," An Cui replied calmly. She gave Shu Baoli a brief, indifferent glance and said, "Be more careful next time. Let’s continue."
She just let Shu Baoli off like that? The onlookers were stunned.
And so, the game continued. Shu Baoli decided to quit while she was ahead. She knew the Lan family was wealthy and powerful, and An Cui was especially favored. If she directly clashed with her, it could end badly for herself.
A new round began, with the ball being passed back and forth. Then, one of the teammates sent the ball high into the air, perfect for a spike. Just as the girl in position prepared to jump and smash it down, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her—faster, swifter. A high ponytail swung through the air, and a slender waist arched gracefully as an arm reached up.
"Bang!"
A fair, jade-like hand forcefully spiked the ball downward. With incredible speed and impact, the ball shot toward Shu Baoli.
She hadn’t expected it at all—caught completely off guard. The fast and powerful ball, still covered in sand, struck her directly in the face.
"Bang!"
The hit was solid and heavy. Shu Baoli fell onto the sandy ground, clutching her nose in pain, tears welling up in her eyes.
The girls stood frozen, staring at An Cui.
“Oh dear, my bad. I didn’t do that on purpose.” An Cui’s tone was completely insincere. In fact, her face openly displayed an arrogant and mocking smirk, making her look utterly wicked.
She had absolutely done that on purpose!!!
From the audience, laughter suddenly erupted.
The girls turned in shock, wondering who could be so rude—then they saw An Ran, bent over, laughing uncontrollably.
“Hahahahahahahaha—”
He Yizhou twitched at the corners of his eyes. So vengeful. He thought it was best to tread carefully and not end up on the young lady’s bad side.
Lan Shengzhe clenched his fists, looking at Shu Baoli with concern.
Shu Baoli lowered her hand and saw the blood on her palm. Her eyes instantly filled with fury. A shadow loomed over her, and when she looked up, she saw An Cui standing above her, looking down with transparent black eyes filled with undisguised mockery and cold disdain.
It was as if she was saying, "What do you amount to?"
The curve of her lips carried a hint of amusement—like a child who found it fun to kick over an anthill.
A sudden chill ran down Shu Baoli’s spine. That’s right.
Ah Zhe had warned her—An Cui wasn’t easy to deal with. She had underestimated her.
"Are you alright? Can you keep playing?" An Cui asked with a fake smile, her eyes gleaming with icy provocation.
Shu Baoli clenched her fists. Endure. She couldn’t go head-to-head with this tyrant. An Cui had already taken her revenge, so she probably wouldn’t push things further. She’d just take this as a lesson.
She was a good student—now that she understood this woman’s way of handling things, she’d know how to counter her in the future.
So she wiped away the blood, stood up, and put on a sweet but fake smile. “I’m fine, I can continue.”
"Good."
An Cui turned back to her team and, as if it were only natural, said, "Pass the ball to me."
Her tone was absolute, her commanding gaze arrogant and oppressive. It made people uncomfortable, but no one dared to openly defy her. The teammates exchanged glances and reluctantly decided to submit to her will.
As the match resumed, another spike opportunity arose. An Cui jumped.
Shu Baoli, thinking that An Cui had already retaliated once and wouldn’t target her again, let her guard down.
Then—"Bang!"
The ball slammed into her face. Again.
Shu Baoli was about to explode with rage. But she still couldn’t fight back—because the Lan family was far superior to the Shu family, and she couldn’t afford to openly challenge An Cui.
She could have just left. But she couldn’t swallow this humiliation—walking away now would be too pathetic, as if she had been beaten into retreat.
So she stood up and kept playing. This time, she was prepared. Yet, when she finally lowered her defenses…
An Cui struck again—another spike, straight to her face!
This time, Shu Baoli really burst into tears.
But what hurt more than her face was the burning hatred searing her heart.
Even though she hadn’t had many friends growing up, she never felt lonely. Her mother had raised her well. Those who gossiped about them were just a bunch of losers, jealous and bitter.
Ugly, judgmental women shackled by outdated moral codes—they had no chance of marrying someone as rich and handsome as her father, so they could only stand on their moral high ground and sneer at her and her mother. But in the end, she and her mother had won. They weren’t abandoned. They rose to the top.
Ha.
With this mindset, Shu Baoli had lived a pampered life, untouched by hardship or humiliation. Even when she clashed with others, it was always through scheming in the shadows—a battle of wits and tactics.
But now, for the first time, she had encountered someone like An Cui. Someone who, in front of everyone, struck her again and again—without even pretending to respect her.
It was infuriating. Absolutely infuriating!!!


===========


Chapter 18: The Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady (Part 9)
524 felt exhilarated, but at the same time, a little apprehensive. The unfolding plot and ending were completely unpredictable, and he wasn’t sure how the audience would respond to a villainous female streamer. After all, in both movies and TV dramas, the female protagonist was usually portrayed in a positive light...
With these thoughts in mind, he answered some questions from other streamers under his management and then checked the recommendation effect for An Cui. While some time had passed in the game, the in-game time flow was set to the fastest speed, meaning only a few hours had elapsed in reality. It was still morning, and many netizens were just waking up, so traffic was expected to increase rapidly.
She had been placed on the “Potential Newcomer Recommendation List,” which was a great ranking. This list was prominently featured on the homepage of the role-playing live streaming section, where many viewers scouted for new streamers.
When 524 opened the page, he was startled by the densely packed barrage of comments flooding the chat.
【First time seeing such a fierce streamer, followed!】 【A ruthless streamer, beating people up live—love it, hahaha!】 【So satisfying, hahaha!】 【I just watched another streamer play The Devil’s Seven-Day Love, and that idiot was going for a ‘tragedy-then-redemption’ arc. She got completely wrecked by Shu Baoli, and I was so frustrated watching it. I didn't even want to wait for her comeback! But now, seeing this, I feel refreshed, hahaha!】 【Came here after watching the previous stream—definitely a unique female streamer. I’m curious about what she actually looks like.】 【The streamer said, "I can even crush the male lead, so what’s a mere villainous side character to me?"】 【Can’t predict what will happen next—exciting and thrilling! Looking forward to it!】 【……】
The gift section was also buzzing, with various gifts pouring in—bouquets ×66, diamonds ×99, villas ×11. The most shocking part? A wealthy viewer had even sent a small planet! That was the most expensive gift, worth 10,000 star coins, more than 524’s five-month salary combined. Just by looking at these gifts, it was clear this new streamer was on the verge of blowing up.
524 suppressed his excitement and checked the number of viewers. It was still at just over 50,000, but the number of users entering the stream was skyrocketing like a rocket launch. He couldn’t take his eyes off the screen.
"Old Wu, your streamer is about to take off," a colleague commented after noticing the rising numbers.
"Hahaha, let’s see how things go. But your ‘Liu Liu Little Cutie’ is also on fire. The charming-heartthrob style always gets a lot of female audience engagement."
"Sigh, it just looks strong on the surface. But it’s not just female viewers watching livestreams—male viewers don’t buy into that route." At best, the popularity would plateau soon.
After some casual chatting, they both returned to work.
524 glanced at the other streamers under his management but ultimately decided to focus on An Cui.

"So pitiful… Senior is being too harsh," someone from An Ran’s group muttered indignantly.
"Yeah, wasn’t it just an accident at first? Does she have to go this far...?"
"Hey, Shuhua, is your cousin always this domineering at home?"
"Hmph." Lan Shuhua didn’t bother answering, but in her heart, she once again felt that An Cui had actually gone easy on her. Compared to that pitiful Shu Baoli, those few slaps were nothing.
An Ran shot a sidelong glance at the person speaking up for Shu Baoli and smirked coldly. "What? 'Do not offend me if I do not offend you; if you offend me, I’ll repay tenfold.' What’s wrong with that?"
"Uh..." The person quickly shook their head frantically.
Lan Shengzhe clenched his fists tightly as he watched Shu Baoli sitting on the ground, crying. He shut his eyes in frustration. I’m sorry, Baoli... I can’t protect you yet... But one day, I will...
When he opened his eyes again, they were filled with cold rage. He looked at An Cui, but the moment their gazes met, all that fury vanished in an instant, replaced by a sharp pang in his heart.
An Cui was staring at him. Arms crossed, she stood tall and proud, her gaze piercing through the crowd to land directly on him—cold and cutting, as if she could see straight through him, making him feel uneasy. Fortunately, she soon looked away.
Lan Shengzhe reassured himself—it must have been an illusion.
The other spectators, who had initially felt satisfaction watching Shu Baoli attack An Cui, now only felt pity seeing her cry on the ground. They were all secretly relieved they hadn’t tried to stand up for her—otherwise, they’d have ended up just like her, beaten down by An Cui.
"Alright, we’ve been training for a while, and everyone’s hungry. Let’s end practice here and go home," said Jiang Qin, the volleyball club captain. In her mind, she had already decided—Shu Baoli needed to leave the club. Otherwise, there would never be peace in their team again.
To be honest, if Shu Baoli hadn’t fought for that ball in the first place, all of this could have been avoided. And based on her keen eye as someone training for professional volleyball, she was certain that Shu Baoli’s move was intentional.
Jiang Qin despised people like her—pretending to be innocent and pure, only to stab others in the back at the slightest chance. Compared to that, she preferred An Cui’s straightforwardness. If An Cui liked someone, she showed it. If she disliked someone, she made it clear. That was way better than unknowingly offending someone and getting secretly plotted against.
Everyone left with mixed emotions, all coming to the same unspoken conclusion—better not mess with this queen of the school.

After changing her clothes, An Cui stepped out to find Lan Shengzhe waiting outside. An Ran was also at the entrance, along with He Yizhou, who hadn’t dared to leave without permission.
"Senior, your plays were incredible! I admire you so much," the exquisite-looking youth said in a slightly fawning tone.
"Of course," An Cui replied without an ounce of humility.
"Then will you come out with us tonight?"
"What does my volleyball skill have to do with going out with you?"
"Obviously, because I’ve been mesmerized by your skills and want to spend time with you!" An Ran leaned in with a charming smile.
He Yizhou: "..." He felt like his head was getting greener.
An Cui reached out and pinched An Ran’s perfectly smooth cheek, her eyes filled with amused arrogance. Then, pressing down on his head, she pushed him aside. "No time. Move."
An Ran’s eyes flashed with disappointment. "…So heartless. My delicate heart is shattered."
But An Cui ignored him, walking off on her own.
Outside the school gate, her family’s car was already waiting. He Yizhou finally seized the chance to excuse himself, and An Cui nodded—his duty as a "slave" was done for the day, so he was free to go.
Lan Shengzhe watched He Yizhou leave with a mocking look. So this was the ‘boyfriend’? Just another kept man. Being summoned and dismissed like that—was he any different from himself?
He followed An Cui into the car, which smoothly drove toward the Lan estate. As she leaned back with her eyes closed, he turned to glance at her. Her profile was stunning, from her smooth forehead to her high nose bridge, down to her lips as red as a blooming rose. The long eyelashes cast delicate shadows on her fair skin.
It was because of this perfection that the tiny red mark on her forehead stood out so much—it was impossible to ignore.
Today, Baoli had been too impulsive.
And then, suddenly, An Cui’s voice rang out: "That Shu Baoli—is she the daughter of Shu Real Estate?"
Lan Shengzhe’s head snapped up. "You already got your revenge!" he blurted out, then immediately regretted his reaction.
An Cui opened her eyes and stared directly at him. "What’s this? You sound like you’re protecting her. Are you two friends?"
His instincts told him to deny it. "No. She’s just a new classmate… I just think… she’s a decent person."
An Cui let out a cold laugh and said nothing more. But her silence made Lan Shengzhe even more uneasy.
When they arrived at the Lan estate, An Cui stepped out and walked toward the house. Without looking back, she ordered: "Go to the attic and reflect on your mistakes."
Lan Shengzhe was stunned. "Why?"
"Come out when you figure it out," she said, never breaking stride—her posture arrogant as ever.



====================

Chapter 19: The Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady (10)
Lan Shengzhe knew he had no right to refuse. He clenched his fists tightly as he watched An Cui’s back, his eyes filled with humiliation.
He went to the attic. The attic was used for storage, so while it wasn’t excessively dusty, it was messy. There was no comfortable seat to sit on, and even the light was broken, left unfixed for a long time.
No one brought Lan Shengzhe dinner, and no one came looking for him. He sat on the cold floor, shrouded in darkness, his whole body trembling. His mind was consumed by thoughts of An Cui—anger, humiliation, hatred. How long had it been? She had punished him twice already. The first time, she whipped him until he was covered in wounds. The second time, she ordered him to come up here and reflect on his mistakes…
Why?
Why did she have the right to treat him like this?
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!!!
One day… One day…
His phone rang—it was Shu Baoli.
Lan Shengzhe saw her name, and amidst his overwhelming negativity, a hint of irritation flickered through his heart.
“Ah Zhe…”
“You were too impulsive. Why did you do something like that on your own? Do you realize she might go after your family?” Lan Shengzhe scolded her sharply.
“I’m sorry, I know I was wrong. I just didn’t expect her to be so arrogant…”
“She’s the eldest daughter of the Lan family. She has every right to be arrogant!”
“Ah Zhe, are you mad at me?”
Lan Shengzhe took a deep breath, hugging his head, feeling guilty for taking out his frustration on his friend. His voice softened, “No… it’s my fault. I know what to do next. You don’t have to worry about it. Just don’t provoke her again. She’s very favored, and it’s highly likely the Lan family will take action against your company if you get on her bad side.”
Shu Baoli immediately said, “Mm, mm, I know you’re looking out for me. I won’t be reckless again. I’ll stay out of her way and make sure she doesn’t notice me.”
They talked for a while. Lan Shengzhe didn’t tell Shu Baoli that he was being confined. After hanging up, he sat with his knees drawn up for a long time before finally standing and leaving the attic.
He walked to An Cui’s bedroom door and knocked.
Before long, An Cui opened the door, looking at him expressionlessly.
Lan Shengzhe clenched his fists, his eyes slightly red. “I know where I was wrong.”
“Speak.”
“I shouldn’t have spoken up for someone who offended you.”
“That’s it?” An Cui looked at him mockingly.
Lan Shengzhe hesitated for a moment, puzzled as to what other reason there could be.
“It seems you really have no self-awareness.” An Cui sneered. “You got the chance to attend First High because of me. You weren’t bullied at school because of me. No one in the Lan family dared to pick on you anymore because of me. From the moment you entered this house, everything you’ve gained was because you pleased me. Since you’ve chosen to be a dog, then be ready to do whatever your master tells you to do. If your friend offends me, the only thing you should do is bite her for me, not worry about me retaliating against her. If you can’t do that, then get lost. A traitor.”
She slammed the door shut.
[524: (Very good, yet another day of deeply offending the male lead.)]
524, who had already given up, casually munched on sunflower seeds, feeling rather Zen about it.
Lan Shengzhe stood in place, staring at the closed door. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes tightly, and only opened them after a long moment. By then, all the turbulent emotions in his eyes had been suppressed. He turned to leave.
However, after walking a short distance, he came back.
But he didn’t knock. Instead, he simply leaned against her door and sat on the floor.
When Lan Shuhua came downstairs to get some water, she saw Lan Shengzhe sitting there like a dog that had been thrown out by its owner. She couldn’t help but sneer, shaking her head in mocking amusement before heading downstairs.
Lan Shengzhe sat there until dawn.
When An Cui opened the door in the morning, she saw the slender, handsome boy curled up against her door, hugging his knees. He looked incredibly pitiful, as if he had no sense of security.
He was a light sleeper and woke up quickly. The moment he realized she had opened the door, he stood up immediately. His legs were numb from sitting all night, and he nearly fell. An Cui casually grabbed his arm to steady him.
Lan Shengzhe froze for a moment, but the hand quickly let go.
“What do you want?” An Cui asked coldly.
Lan Shengzhe’s eyes were slightly misty, filled with struggle, shame, and endurance. “I didn’t please you just for convenience…”
An Cui looked at him, intrigued, waiting for him to continue.
Lan Shengzhe’s face grew redder and redder. In the end, he turned his head away in frustration. “Forget it. It’s nothing.” He grabbed her schoolbag and turned to go downstairs first.
An Cui watched his retreating figure, her brows arching in amusement.
Not only did Lan Shengzhe not distance himself from An Cui after she mercilessly humiliated him yesterday, but he became even more eager to please her.
Shu Baoli thought the matter had ended after An Cui’s revenge yesterday. However, neither she nor Lan Shengzhe expected An Cui to be even pettier and more ruthless than they had imagined.
When An Cui arrived at school, she spread the word: she hated Shu Baoli.
An Cui was a tyrant at school. Many people secretly resented her, but just as many wanted to please her. Some even admired her untouchable, high-and-mighty attitude. After all, almost everyone has a subconscious admiration for strength. Though they called her arrogant and overbearing, deep down, they envied her ability to act without consequence.
Moreover, for some reason, An Ran seemed to have a good impression of An Cui. He immediately declared that he also hated Shu Baoli.
With both top figures of First High expressing their dislike, there was no way Shu Baoli could have peaceful days at school.
Even though she was sweet and cute, there were many cute girls. But school elites like them? There were only two. Now that these elites had spoken, of course, others wanted to take action to curry favor—maybe even join their circle.
And so, for the first time, Shu Baoli, who had always been the bully, became the bullied.
Unlike in her small town, where rich people were few and not that wealthy, First High was full of second-generation elites and nouveaux riches. Shu Baoli was insignificant here, like a country girl stepping into the city for the first time, experiencing firsthand how small and powerless she truly was.
[524 sensed something was off and checked the live chat—sure enough, viewers were arguing fiercely.]
Some were saying An Cui was being excessive. Others were defending her. Some called the streamer more villainous than a stereotypical evil supporting character. Meanwhile, 524 pondered whether to inform An Cui but quickly dismissed the thought—she was too headstrong to care.
As long as the tips kept rolling in and the viewer count continued to grow, it didn’t matter. This was An Cui’s style, and the audience would have to get used to it.

Lan Shengzhe witnessed Shu Baoli’s suffering but didn’t dare show a hint of discontent or sympathy. Every time he wanted to rush forward, An Cui’s cold and ruthless face, the whip against his skin, and the freezing attic would flash through his mind. His heart would tremble, and his reason would take over.
Once again, he saw An Cui’s cold cruelty.
And so, his determination grew stronger.

After the morning classes ended, Lan Shengzhe immediately headed to the cafeteria. By the time An Cui arrived, he was already waiting for her on the second floor with a tray full of sweet and sour ribs, stir-fried chili pork, and crispy chicken cutlets—it all looked absolutely delicious.
The last period had been PE class, and An Cui was starving. She wanted food, so she took it. As an utterly self-centered and spoiled young lady, she had no intention of denying herself anything.
He Yizhou had gone to queue for food, but An Cui had already accepted Lan Shengzhe’s offering and started eating. In a rare act of generosity, she even allowed Lan Shengzhe to sit beside her.
So when He Yizhou finally returned with his food, he saw his so-called girlfriend—who was essentially his slave master—already eating, while another boy had taken his usual seat.
He Yizhou: ???? What the hell? Why do I feel so annoyed???
He quickly pushed aside the irritation in his heart and suddenly realized—wasn’t this the perfect chance to break up?
With a slightly sour expression, he walked over and said, “Shengmei, you’re already eating?”
An Ran's gaze flickered between the three of them with an unreadable expression, while the others around them looked on with amused anticipation.
Sipping the milk tea An Ran had given her, An Cui nodded matter-of-factly and replied, “You were too slow.”
“…Then what am I supposed to do with this?” He Yizhou looked down at the two trays of food in his hands, feeling somewhat dejected.
At this moment, Lan Shengzhe spoke up somewhat sheepishly, “Can I have it, senior? I think I can eat more.”
He Yizhou: “……” I swear, I just want to dump this tray on your face, you sneaky little bastard.


======================



Chapter 20: The Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady (11)
He Yizhou soon realized that Lan Shengzhe hadn’t just taken over the job of getting food for An Cui. In the past, whenever An Cui suddenly craved the handmade bread from the school convenience store, wanted a drink, or even needed something as trivial as a pack of tissues, she would naturally order him to buy it, as if it were the most reasonable thing in the world—so much so that it nearly drove him to the brink of frustration.
But now, all of these tasks had fallen to Lan Shengzhe. No, rather than "fallen to," it would be more accurate to say they had been "snatched away." Whenever he had free time, he would show up in the senior year classrooms, often bringing something with him—either food or drinks.
Although He Yizhou intended to use this as an opportunity to sever ties with An Cui, he couldn’t shake an unsettling feeling. Even if it was something he no longer wanted, having it snatched away without permission was bound to be irritating.
Moreover, he was certain that this illegitimate child was extremely calculating. The recent shift in how people talked about him was proof enough.
"He looks kind of pitiful when you think about it..."
"Yeah, kind of tragic... Honestly, it’s the adults who are at fault. It’s not like he had a choice about being born to whom."
"He’s being ordered around constantly..."
"..."
Weak people always evoke sympathy, especially when they happen to be good-looking. It stirred the innate nurturing instincts in some girls, who took the initiative to befriend Lan Shengzhe. Since he had been currying favor with An Cui and she hadn’t rejected him, his first year in high school had been bearable—at least, he hadn’t been outright bullied. But now, things were gradually improving. Whenever someone tried to insult him, they barely got two words out before some girl, hands on her hips, would snap back in his defense.
And all of this was because he kept hovering around An Cui, constantly fawning over her, crafting the image of a pitiful younger brother being bullied by his domineering half-sister. Eventually, public opinion swung in his favor, and he started experiencing a normal high school life.
Of course, every situation has two sides.
An Cui had three loyal followers who had attached themselves to her: Zhou Biyu, Lin Shu, and Yang Momei. Their roles were exactly like those of the minions who followed the rich, vicious supporting female characters in every novel—trailing behind her, carrying out her orders, and, when necessary, being used as pawns. Of course, there was no guarantee that they wouldn’t turn on her one day or end up as liabilities.
Since An Cui already had He Yizhou—her so-called boyfriend but actual servant—she rarely needed their help. Still, they occasionally managed to snatch a bit of work. But ever since Lan Shengzhe appeared, they found themselves completely sidelined.
What was this guy, a first-year student, always doing in their senior-year classrooms? And why did he always bring snacks, drinks, and chocolates? The moment An Cui mentioned wanting something, he would sprint off faster than the wind to fetch it, leaving them far behind. How infuriating! How were they supposed to remain her loyal followers? How would they ever earn her favor? If this continued, An Cui would see them as useless and cast them aside!
They were furious. So, they decided to teach him a lesson—of course, not personally, but by having other first-year students do it for them.
Over the next few days, Lan Shengzhe’s books mysteriously disappeared without a trace. His desk was thrown downstairs. He was locked inside a restroom stall after school and doused with water…
Now, soaking wet and utterly miserable, he sat on the toilet, idly playing with his phone. Outside, the sounds gradually faded as the school emptied, leaving only the duty staff behind.
He leaned against the wall, silently waiting for the sunset to fade, the night to fall, and the school gates to be locked. In the darkness of the restroom stall, he sent An Cui a text message.
—Can you save me? I’m locked inside the school restroom.
By now, it was dinnertime. The Lan family certainly wouldn’t wait for him. At most, they might casually ask about his absence, but no one would truly care. At a time like this, any soft-hearted person receiving such a message would inevitably feel sorry for him.
An Cui stared at the message on her phone, raised an eyebrow, and put down her chopsticks.
"I’m full. You guys enjoy." She then turned to one of her cousins, Lan Qifeng. "Qifeng, lend me your bike."
Lan Qifeng cherished his bike, and he was known as an untouchable school bully. But when faced with An Cui’s straightforward request—accompanied by an outstretched hand—he hesitated. Remembering how she had beaten Lan Shengzhe before, he found it hard to summon the courage to refuse. In the end, he reluctantly handed over the keys.
"But, sis… do you even know how to ride?" he asked, still hoping she’d reconsider.
Taking the keys, An Cui gave him a sideways glance. "Some things don’t require learning. They come naturally."
"..."
She headed to the garage, where Lan Qifeng’s nearly seven-figure heavy motorcycle stood—a sleek, powerful machine that any teenager would find cool. Swinging a long leg over it, she settled into the seat, put on a matching helmet, and revved the engine. The bike let out a deep, intoxicating growl. Releasing the clutch, she sped out of the garage, out of the estate, and onto the open road.

Would she come?
Lan Shengzhe began to shiver. The cold, damp stall only made it worse. This was a crucial step in his plan. From everything An Cui had said and done, he had realized one thing—if she only saw him as a dog, then he was nothing more than something to be beaten and discarded at will. He had to change that. He had to win her over.
Her position in the Lan family was unmatched, doted on by both elders of the household. If he wanted a place in the family, he could only rely on her.
He needed her affection.
From the way she handled things, it was clear—she was just an arrogant young lady, too proud to play mind games. She was straightforward, which made her easy to win over. If she came tonight, then he would have his answer.
The cold seeped into his bones, bringing back memories of winter nights with his mother. Their thin blankets had never been enough to keep him warm, but he had never complained, not wanting to burden her further. He had simply curled up tightly under the covers, enduring the cold in silence.
Every minute stretched unbearably long. It had been an hour since he sent the message. No reply. No sound from outside. Had he miscalculated?
A wave of frustration and resentment welled up. Why isn’t she coming? Even if he was just a dog, after all these days of devoted service, she should at least have a sliver of sympathy for him!
Just as his exhaustion began to take over, just as his eyelids drooped, he heard footsteps approaching.
Then, the stall door swung open, and a beam of light cut through the darkness, shining directly into his eyes.
Lan Shengzhe blinked and looked up at the girl standing outside, arms crossed, staring down at him with an expressionless face.
"Useless."
She didn’t hold back. But hearing those words, a rush of joy surged in his chest.
He hadn’t miscalculated. She came.
His fever-weakened limbs trembled as he wrapped himself in a large towel, watching as An Cui berated the school principal for the security staff’s negligence. The principal nodded repeatedly in embarrassment, while the guards hung their heads in shame.
So imposing—like a queen.
Like a baby emperor penguin following its mother, he wobbled after her. Suddenly, something black was tossed his way. He fumbled but barely caught it.
A helmet.
"Put it on. Get on the bike."
An Cui was already astride the motorcycle.
Lan Shengzhe murmured an "Oh," slipped on the helmet, and climbed onto the back seat.
The black motorcycle roared to life, speeding down the road. Wind and engine growls filled his ears. He tried to keep some distance, gripping the seat instead of her waist, but the downward slope of the seat betrayed him, and he kept sliding closer.
Then, the bike swerved sharply. He nearly flew off, a passing truck grazing his helmet, sending a jolt of fear through him.
"If you don’t want to die, hold on tight. Don’t cause trouble."
Stiffly, hesitantly, he reached out—wrapping his arms around her waist.
