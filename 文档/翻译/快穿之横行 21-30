Chapter 21: Arrogant and Overbearing Young Lady 12

This was his first time holding a girl’s waist, and the girl was his half-sister, the high-and-mighty girl, An Cui, who had never cared for him. It felt strange. Though she was sharp and could hurt people anytime, she indeed had a surprisingly soft and delicate side, whether it was her waist or her heart.

Holding her waist, almost leaning against her back, and perhaps due to the half-wet clothes, he surprisingly found that the woman he intended to vent his future revenge on was so warm, making him feel as though even the cold of winter could be chased away.

Lan Shengzhe had a fever. After returning to the Lan family, he immediately changed into dry clothes, drank some porridge, took medicine, and went to bed to sleep. According to the servants assigned to take care of him, he muttered in his sleep the whole night, intermittently calling out "sister."

Sister? Which sister does he have?

For a moment, the servants in the annex felt some pity for him, while others thought it was what he deserved. The more these opinions spread, the more it reached the ears of his grandparents. They had heard about it, but they didn’t show any expression, only glancing at him more than usual during mealtime.

Naturally, this news also reached An Cui’s ears.

An Cui did not react. She got up and went to school. Even with a slight fever, Lan Shengzhe immediately grabbed both his and her school bags and followed her.

Probably because of the fever, Lan Shengzhe was a bit muddled, and only on his way back to his class after sending An Cui to hers did he realize he had grabbed the wrong bag. Since all the bags at their school were issued by the school and looked the same, he had absent-mindedly left his on An Cui’s desk and taken hers instead. As class was about to start, if she opened the bag and found his things inside, she would surely get angry. He quickly turned around and headed upstairs.

"That shameless bastard Lan Shengzhe, doesn’t he know how disgusting he is to you?!" He suddenly heard an agitated female voice. Stopping in his tracks, he immediately hid behind the wall.

The voice came from the upper stairwell, and it sounded familiar, probably one of An Cui's lackeys.

"His very existence is like a hammer that shatters your father's image of authority! He’s the proof of his betrayal of your mother! What legitimate child wouldn't find him disgusting? You're such a proud person, I can't believe you don't hate him! I only got someone to deal with him because I wanted to make you happy! Shengmei, we are the ones who are your true friends!"

"That's right, we did all of this for your sake, Shengmei..."

"Enough," An Cui said coldly. "You only think he’s affecting your interests. Stop using these pretentious reasons to fool me. Lan Shengzhe, no matter how much I dislike him, is still my half-brother. No one else has the right to bully him except me."

Lan Shengzhe froze.

There was another round of arguing and pleading, and then it became quiet. It seemed they had left.

Lan Shengzhe leaned against the wall, and it wasn't until the school bell rang that he suddenly came back to his senses. He hurriedly grabbed his school bag and went upstairs.

It seemed that An Cui had just opened her bag and was frowning at his math book. Lan Shengzhe rushed in and exchanged bags with her. Glancing at An Cui’s face, he saw a bit of disdain and impatience, but she didn’t say anything.

Lan Shengzhe carried his own bag downstairs. The bell had already rung for class, but he wasn’t in a hurry to return to his class. As he walked, he couldn’t stop thinking about An Cui’s words...

No, calm down, Lan Shengzhe, do you really want to forget how your mother died? Why does An Cui find his existence disgusting? What authority does that man even have? Even if he didn’t exist, he was an unfaithful man. Even if An Cui might actually see him as a brother, she just sees him as a brother she can bully or abandon, like a worthless, emotionless dog.

He took a deep breath, suppressing the strange feeling in his heart, and walked on with a gloomy expression.

When he returned to his seat in class, he found a few letters in his drawer. Opening one, he saw more words of encouragement, even some curses against An Cui, showing their righteous indignation.

It was ridiculous. They didn’t even have the courage to leave their names on the letters, but they wanted to save him? They thought writing a few words didn’t cost much effort or anything, pretending to be on his side, but they were actually just venting their dissatisfaction with An Cui. Some even subtly urged him to resist An Cui, trying to make her suffer.

He had met too many people like that. Maybe human nature was just that disgusting.

Lan Shengzhe thought coldly but still put on a grateful and obedient face, carefully putting the letters in his bag, intending to deal with them after school.

However, when he got in the car after school, he hadn’t yet had time to handle these letters, when An Cui said, “Give me your bag.”

Lan Shengzhe immediately broke out in a cold sweat, his heart pounding. He thought, “Did she find out? Does she know I have things in my bag that she dislikes? What will happen if she sees these letters? What kind of punishment will she give me?”

Seeing him frozen, An Cui raised an eyebrow and asked, “Do I need to say it again?”

Lan Shengzhe had no choice but to nervously pass her the bag, his heart racing as he quickly thought of ways to minimize An Cui’s anger.

An Cui unzipped his bag and casually pulled out a few books and exercise books. As she looked at them, her frown deepened. “Lan Shengzhe, you can’t even get these simple questions right? Are you planning to fail the midterm exam?”

Lan Shengzhe: “...”

Later that evening, An Cui instructed the servants to dump a thick stack of test papers and exercises in front of Lan Shengzhe. 524 felt a sense of dread. Lan Shengzhe instantly wished he could turn back time to the morning and knock some sense into himself so he wouldn’t have grabbed the wrong bag. Then An Cui wouldn’t have seen his math book, wouldn’t have found out he was struggling to keep up with the schoolwork, and he wouldn’t have ended up in this predicament.

The fact that Lan Shengzhe couldn’t keep up with the schoolwork wasn’t entirely his fault. The school was a noble institution that placed great emphasis on academic performance. With such strong teachers and top-tier textbooks, it was normal for Lan Shengzhe to fall behind after transferring from his previous school.

However, An Cui felt that if he got a poor grade on the midterm exam, it would be embarrassing for her, so she scolded him and demanded that he improve his grades immediately.

Lan Shengzhe sat at his desk, staring at the crazy pile of homework An Cui had assigned. After a while, he suddenly slapped his face. This was a golden opportunity! It was as if someone had handed him a pillow when he was feeling sleepy.

Lan Shengzhe quickly seized the chance. Whenever he encountered a question he couldn’t solve, he shamelessly went to An Cui for help, knowing she would often teach him.

He was surprised to find that An Cui was such a scholar. Though she had always been a good student, her arrogant and overbearing attitude made her seem like someone who wouldn’t bother to study. Yet, when she explained the questions, she did so with ease, as if it was second nature to her.

He often found himself entranced by her voice as she explained, then quickly snapped out of it, as though nothing had happened. Deep down, he felt uneasy. Was this really the right way forward?

No, no, no. This is exactly what he wanted. The more she invests in him now, the deeper her feelings will grow. She won’t see him as a dog anymore, and he can use her to gain more power. Once he’s strong enough, he’ll take revenge and avenge his mother!
