Chapter 21: Arrogant and Overbearing Young Lady 12

This was his first time holding a girl’s waist, and the girl was his half-sister, the high-and-mighty girl, An Cui, who had never cared for him. It felt strange. Though she was sharp and could hurt people anytime, she indeed had a surprisingly soft and delicate side, whether it was her waist or her heart.

Holding her waist, almost leaning against her back, and perhaps due to the half-wet clothes, he surprisingly found that the woman he intended to vent his future revenge on was so warm, making him feel as though even the cold of winter could be chased away.

Lan Shengzhe had a fever. After returning to the Lan family, he immediately changed into dry clothes, drank some porridge, took medicine, and went to bed to sleep. According to the servants assigned to take care of him, he muttered in his sleep the whole night, intermittently calling out "sister."

Sister? Which sister does he have?

For a moment, the servants in the annex felt some pity for him, while others thought it was what he deserved. The more these opinions spread, the more it reached the ears of his grandparents. They had heard about it, but they didn’t show any expression, only glancing at him more than usual during mealtime.

Naturally, this news also reached An Cui’s ears.

An Cui did not react. She got up and went to school. Even with a slight fever, Lan Shengzhe immediately grabbed both his and her school bags and followed her.

Probably because of the fever, Lan Shengzhe was a bit muddled, and only on his way back to his class after sending An Cui to hers did he realize he had grabbed the wrong bag. Since all the bags at their school were issued by the school and looked the same, he had absent-mindedly left his on An Cui’s desk and taken hers instead. As class was about to start, if she opened the bag and found his things inside, she would surely get angry. He quickly turned around and headed upstairs.

"That shameless bastard Lan Shengzhe, doesn’t he know how disgusting he is to you?!" He suddenly heard an agitated female voice. Stopping in his tracks, he immediately hid behind the wall.

The voice came from the upper stairwell, and it sounded familiar, probably one of An Cui's lackeys.

"His very existence is like a hammer that shatters your father's image of authority! He’s the proof of his betrayal of your mother! What legitimate child wouldn't find him disgusting? You're such a proud person, I can't believe you don't hate him! I only got someone to deal with him because I wanted to make you happy! Shengmei, we are the ones who are your true friends!"

"That's right, we did all of this for your sake, Shengmei..."

"Enough," An Cui said coldly. "You only think he’s affecting your interests. Stop using these pretentious reasons to fool me. Lan Shengzhe, no matter how much I dislike him, is still my half-brother. No one else has the right to bully him except me."

Lan Shengzhe froze.

There was another round of arguing and pleading, and then it became quiet. It seemed they had left.

Lan Shengzhe leaned against the wall, and it wasn't until the school bell rang that he suddenly came back to his senses. He hurriedly grabbed his school bag and went upstairs.

It seemed that An Cui had just opened her bag and was frowning at his math book. Lan Shengzhe rushed in and exchanged bags with her. Glancing at An Cui’s face, he saw a bit of disdain and impatience, but she didn’t say anything.

Lan Shengzhe carried his own bag downstairs. The bell had already rung for class, but he wasn’t in a hurry to return to his class. As he walked, he couldn’t stop thinking about An Cui’s words...

No, calm down, Lan Shengzhe, do you really want to forget how your mother died? Why does An Cui find his existence disgusting? What authority does that man even have? Even if he didn’t exist, he was an unfaithful man. Even if An Cui might actually see him as a brother, she just sees him as a brother she can bully or abandon, like a worthless, emotionless dog.

He took a deep breath, suppressing the strange feeling in his heart, and walked on with a gloomy expression.

When he returned to his seat in class, he found a few letters in his drawer. Opening one, he saw more words of encouragement, even some curses against An Cui, showing their righteous indignation.

It was ridiculous. They didn’t even have the courage to leave their names on the letters, but they wanted to save him? They thought writing a few words didn’t cost much effort or anything, pretending to be on his side, but they were actually just venting their dissatisfaction with An Cui. Some even subtly urged him to resist An Cui, trying to make her suffer.

He had met too many people like that. Maybe human nature was just that disgusting.

Lan Shengzhe thought coldly but still put on a grateful and obedient face, carefully putting the letters in his bag, intending to deal with them after school.

However, when he got in the car after school, he hadn’t yet had time to handle these letters, when An Cui said, “Give me your bag.”

Lan Shengzhe immediately broke out in a cold sweat, his heart pounding. He thought, “Did she find out? Does she know I have things in my bag that she dislikes? What will happen if she sees these letters? What kind of punishment will she give me?”

Seeing him frozen, An Cui raised an eyebrow and asked, “Do I need to say it again?”

Lan Shengzhe had no choice but to nervously pass her the bag, his heart racing as he quickly thought of ways to minimize An Cui’s anger.

An Cui unzipped his bag and casually pulled out a few books and exercise books. As she looked at them, her frown deepened. “Lan Shengzhe, you can’t even get these simple questions right? Are you planning to fail the midterm exam?”

Lan Shengzhe: “...”

Later that evening, An Cui instructed the servants to dump a thick stack of test papers and exercises in front of Lan Shengzhe. 524 felt a sense of dread. Lan Shengzhe instantly wished he could turn back time to the morning and knock some sense into himself so he wouldn’t have grabbed the wrong bag. Then An Cui wouldn’t have seen his math book, wouldn’t have found out he was struggling to keep up with the schoolwork, and he wouldn’t have ended up in this predicament.

The fact that Lan Shengzhe couldn’t keep up with the schoolwork wasn’t entirely his fault. The school was a noble institution that placed great emphasis on academic performance. With such strong teachers and top-tier textbooks, it was normal for Lan Shengzhe to fall behind after transferring from his previous school.

However, An Cui felt that if he got a poor grade on the midterm exam, it would be embarrassing for her, so she scolded him and demanded that he improve his grades immediately.

Lan Shengzhe sat at his desk, staring at the crazy pile of homework An Cui had assigned. After a while, he suddenly slapped his face. This was a golden opportunity! It was as if someone had handed him a pillow when he was feeling sleepy.

Lan Shengzhe quickly seized the chance. Whenever he encountered a question he couldn’t solve, he shamelessly went to An Cui for help, knowing she would often teach him.

He was surprised to find that An Cui was such a scholar. Though she had always been a good student, her arrogant and overbearing attitude made her seem like someone who wouldn’t bother to study. Yet, when she explained the questions, she did so with ease, as if it was second nature to her.

He often found himself entranced by her voice as she explained, then quickly snapped out of it, as though nothing had happened. Deep down, he felt uneasy. Was this really the right way forward?

No, no, no. This is exactly what he wanted. The more she invests in him now, the deeper her feelings will grow. She won’t see him as a dog anymore, and he can use her to gain more power. Once he’s strong enough, he’ll take revenge and avenge his mother!

Chapter 22: Arrogant and Domineering Young Lady 13

Everyone in the Lan family noticed that since Lan Shengzhe had that fever, he had become increasingly clingy toward An Cui. Yes, clingy. If before, he had only reluctantly been attentive to her, now it was as if An Cui had conquered him, and he had started sticking to her. The humiliation and restraint on his face had disappeared, replaced by genuine affection from a younger brother to an older sister. His speech became more natural, and he occasionally shamelessly acted cute toward An Cui, even calling her "sister" in an audacious way.

Though An Cui hadn’t been particularly kind to him, she didn’t seem to mind and hadn’t stopped him from following her around. To many, it seemed that the young lady had started accepting his pace.

There was even a time when they caught An Cui teaching Lan Shengzhe how to do homework!

In short, because of this, he was no longer invisible in the Lan family. At least when he wasn't at the dinner table, his grandparents would occasionally ask about him.

He had broken the deadlock, making a small crack in a world where he didn’t belong. Like another bubble, he stuck to it, gradually merging himself with the larger bubble.

524 couldn’t help but remind An Cui: [He’s trying to use you and manipulate your rhythm.]

[I know.]

524: [Considering how much hate you’ve drawn from the male lead, my advice is to just get rid of him, or he’ll make sure to grind you to dust in the future.] After all, he had already broken the pot, so it was pointless to expect any romantic development with the male lead. The priority now was to avoid being bullied.

[No.]

524: [Why not?]

[This is how the game is played, and isn’t this what you wanted to see?]

[...] Fine, he kept quiet.

He Yi Zhou observed from the sidelines, thinking that Lan Shengmei, that self-centered and arrogant person, was probably no match for this younger brother.

But why should he care? Although displeased, it was still better to seize this opportunity to break up with An Cui.

However, before he could break up with An Cui, something else happened.

After being slapped in the women’s restroom and soaked with water, Shu Baoli trembled all over, her veins popping as she could no longer hold her anger in.

Just then, she received a message on her phone.

“I think you could use this.”

Along with the message came a video. She opened it, and it was a recording from the volleyball practice match she and An Cui had participated in. The video didn’t capture the moment when she hit An Cui, but it did show An Cui repeatedly hitting her, and in the end, her sitting on the ground crying.

Even if the video had captured her hitting An Cui, it didn’t matter because, in comparison to An Cui’s arrogant and domineering attitude later on, her hit seemed insignificant. Anyone who saw this video would feel sympathy for her, the one being hit, and disgust for An Cui, the one bullying her.

“What’s your goal?” Shu Baoli replied.

“Of course, the goal is for you to get back at Lan Shengmei. This person is too arrogant and annoying, right?”

Shu Baoli coldly curled her lips. She didn’t mind being used as a pawn because she was so furious. That woman had gone too far, so she gladly accepted this timely help.

After school, Shu Baoli didn’t go home. She went online.

She had a Weibo account under the name “Baoli is Baby,” with 200,000 followers. She had gained fame by posting about luxury bags, clothes, and some public little diaries. These diaries shared bits and pieces of her life, either real or fabricated, about family relationships or her ambiguous friendship/romance with a childhood friend. They were written in a cute and sweet way, occasionally posting lovely pictures of herself, making her account feel like a novel. Some believed it was fake, others thought it was real, but over the years, she had gained so many followers.

However, Shu Baoli didn’t post the video with her main account. She first uploaded it with a secondary account, titled: [Money really can make you do whatever you want…] Then, she skillfully hired internet trolls, and finally used another secondary account to pretend to recognize the person being hit as Shu Baoli, tagging her main account and notifying her group chat...

She had been on Weibo for many years, mastering these marketing tactics. After completing the first step, she used another small account to expose An Cui’s identity as the daughter of the Lan family, which immediately brought attention to a famous domestic conglomerate and the current hot topic of school bullying. It quickly gained massive attention and shot up to the trending searches.

#Lan Family Young Lady School Bullying#

#Baoli is Baby#

The two hashtags shot to the top of the trending list with astonishing speed.

“My God, this is too much, again and again!”

“I’m so angry I could cry. So many people, and not one of them tried to stop it, even helped the bully by passing the ball to that female tyrant. I can’t imagine how cold the bullied girl must have felt.”

“Today’s kids are really demons. Lan Shengmei is the demon among demons!”

“The Lan family is so rich, making so much money, and this is the kind of person they raised??”

“I’ll never buy anything from the Lan family again!”

“Lan Shengmei, come out and apologize! Lan family, come out and apologize!!”

“I saw the bullied girl’s Weibo. She’s such a cute angel, I can only imagine how heartbroken her parents must be!”

“Boycott everything under the Lan family’s brand!!”

…

The comments from netizens were overwhelmingly in Shu Baoli’s favor. Lan Shengmei did have a Weibo, but since An Cui took over, she hadn’t logged in. Her Weibo was dug up, and a flood of strangers swarmed in, leaving all kinds of insults.

Shu Baoli couldn’t help but want to post something on her main account, but she quickly remembered that she shouldn’t speak out. Sometimes silence was the most powerful weapon.

After handling all this, she left the internet, feeling completely satisfied.

She was curious how Lan Shengmei would try to explain herself, because she was indeed such an arrogant person. If reporters went to interview anyone from the school, the words they’d hear would only make Lan Shengmei’s image worse! Was it possible for anyone to lie through their teeth and say that Lan Shengmei was kind-hearted and never bullied her classmates?

This incident quickly gained traction online, with more people claiming to be students from her school, saying that Lan Shengmei had indeed been bullying Shu Baoli. Lan Shengmei had a domineering personality, and was known as a school bully who walked all over her school. Even her younger siblings were afraid of her and were treated like slaves. This whole situation pushed Lan Shengmei and the Lan family to the forefront.

Lan Shengzhe watched the insults directed at An Cui online and frowned as he read the filthy language. What was this feeling? He clearly hated the Lan family, hated An Cui, yet when he saw these hateful comments online, he didn’t feel any sense of satisfaction.

He even felt that this method of revenge, against An Cui's proud, beautiful, and arrogant stance... was so beneath her.
