Chapter 10: The Cook (9)

Although Lin Dan had intentionally made extra food for dinner, everyone still didn’t get quite enough to eat. The main reason was the three burly men, who had enormous appetites and ate the rolled pancakes at an astonishing speed. While others had just finished one, they had already stuffed down three each, which was truly infuriating to watch.

Lin Dan, as usual, ate very little. Her cough worsened at night, so after taking her medicine, she crawled into the carriage to sleep. The rest of the group naturally lightened their movements, careful not to disturb her.

The three burly men found an open area to sit and keep watch over the caravan for the night. They seemed to be well accustomed to such a life of sleeping in the open. While everyone else in the caravan had already dozed off from exhaustion, they remained full of energy.

“No wonder Old Shen was so reluctant to part with Shopkeeper Lin when he left,” Luo Tietou said, lying on the ground and idly patting his stomach. “He even said that since Lin is sick, nothing tastes good to him anymore. Now I get it.” He smacked his lips and sighed. “That spring three-delicacy pancake was damn delicious! Too bad there wasn’t enough—I’m still not quite full.”

“Are you hungry again?” Zhao Liu asked, poking at the campfire with a wooden stick.

“I am,” Luo Tietou muttered as he turned over and smacked his lips. “I wonder what we’ll have for breakfast tomorrow. I still want more pancakes.”

Thinking about the taste of those pancakes, Zhao Liu secretly swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He also wanted more. Those pancakes were so fresh and flavorful—he could eat them every day for three months and never get tired of them.

“Enough. Get some sleep, I’ll keep watch,” the handsome and imposing man ordered in a low voice.

The leader's words were absolute, so Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou didn't argue and soon fell asleep. Not long after, the silence of the night was interrupted by the sound of stomachs growling, but luckily, everyone was already asleep and no one noticed.

The next morning, Lin Dan’s health had improved even more. Before dawn, she was already up, preparing breakfast for everyone. Seeing that their shopkeeper had risen early, the assistants naturally couldn’t laze around either. They got up one by one to fetch water and start the fire.

“You kept watch all night?” Lin Dan asked in mild surprise when she saw the handsome man sitting by the fire.

The man nodded. He opened his mouth as if to say something but then hesitated.

Lin Dan noticed his hesitation and took the initiative to ask, “Is something wrong?”

“No.” The man hesitated again, then finally couldn’t resist asking, “What’s for breakfast?”

Lin Dan chuckled. “I’ll cook a pot of white rice porridge, boil some noodles, and make a few side dishes. You can have porridge or noodles—whichever you prefer.”

The man nodded and said nothing more. However, the two burly men beside him had woken up and groaned, “Shopkeeper Lin, why aren’t we having pancakes? White porridge and noodles can’t compare to those delicious pancakes.”

Lin Dan shook her head with a smile. “No matter how good something is, you can’t eat it every day. It’s important to change flavors now and then.”

Shaoyao walked over, grinning. “Master, the dough is ready, and the porridge is simmering. You can start cooking the side dishes now.” Then she turned to Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou with a teasing smile. “You two really don’t know how lucky you are. My master can cook hundreds of different dishes without repeating a single one, and we’re barely able to taste them all. Yet here you are, complaining.”

“No complaints! No complaints! Whatever Shopkeeper Lin makes, we’ll eat,” the two burly men quickly backtracked under their leader’s glare. But deep down, they still longed for last night’s pancakes. White porridge and noodles—how could they compare to the taste of spring three-delicacy pancakes?

But soon, Shopkeeper Lin showed them with her actions that as long as the cook had real skill, even the simplest white porridge and noodles could become an extraordinary feast.

She took some preserved pork fat from a jar, chopped it finely, and stir-fried it in a pan. Then she added blanched Chinese toon shoots, dicing them and mixing them with the crispy pork fat. The juices from the toon shoots and the oil from the pork fat blended together, forming a thick and fragrant sauce. As the mixture simmered, bubbles popped, releasing bursts of rich aroma. Once the pork fat softened and the fragrance of the toon shoots was fully extracted, Lin Dan quickly added soy sauce, fine salt, and ground pepper, stirring everything together before taking it off the heat.

“It smells amazing!” Shaoyao and Dujuan carried away the bowl of sauce together, sniffing eagerly as they walked.

Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou, who originally had no interest in eating noodles, now found themselves struggling to keep their mouths from watering.

Still unsatisfied, Lin Dan steamed a large bowl of salted fish, made a cold salad with Indian aster, and took out some pickled vegetables from a jar, placing them neatly onto plates. Only then did she begin rolling and cutting the hand-stretched noodles. By the time the noodles were cooked, the porridge was also perfectly done. Everyone hurried to grab their bowls and chopsticks, eager to eat.

“Alright, dig in! The sooner we finish, the sooner we can get on the road,” Lin Dan said as she washed her hands and calmly lowered her sleeves.

The three burly men, being martial artists, were naturally fast eaters. In the blink of an eye, they had each scooped up three bowls of steaming hot noodles, mixed in the sauce, and started slurping them down. The combination of the rich, nutty toon shoots and the crispy, fragrant pork fat was absolutely irresistible. The tender freshness of the toon shoots perfectly balanced the crispy chewiness of the pork fat, creating an unbelievably delicious flavor.

The noodles themselves were incredibly springy, each strand absorbing the savory sauce completely. With just one bite, the soft yet chewy texture, combined with the rich, salty-sweet flavor, completely won over their taste buds.

Delicious—unbelievably delicious! The three of them widened their eyes in delight, speeding up their eating pace. Seeing them gobble up their food, the rest of the group naturally didn’t dare to lag behind. The camp soon filled with nothing but the sounds of eager slurping.

Still recovering from her illness, Lin Dan had little appetite and only drank a bowl of plain porridge before stopping.

The handsome man looked up at her with concern and asked, “Shopkeeper Lin, are you feeling unwell?”

The man carefully observed her. Seeing that her complexion was rosy and her eyes were bright—without any signs of worsening illness—he finally felt relieved.

Sitting beside him, Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou only slowed down their eating pace after finishing three bowls of noodles. Though they were already seventy percent full, they still scooped up a bowl of white porridge to cleanse their palate.

The porridge was just plain white porridge, without any particularly strong flavor—mild and bland when eaten alone. The two of them instinctively picked up some pickled vegetables and mixed them into the porridge. Taking a small sip, they were instantly amazed.

The pickled vegetables were made from finely chopped water celery, mixed with vinegar, sesame, and fennel. They had a crisp texture, a slightly rich sour and salty taste, but when paired with the mildly sweet white porridge, the flavor became perfectly balanced and incredibly fragrant. Drinking it slowly, they felt as if their whole body relaxed, with their stomachs feeling especially soothed.

Another dish served with the porridge was fermented black bean steamed salted fish. No one knew what secret technique Lin the shopkeeper had used, but the originally firm-textured salted fish had been steamed until it was tender and glutinous. The rich juices slowly seeped from the meat, blending with the aroma of the fermented black beans, making it utterly mouthwatering. Not only was the fish meat soft, but even the bones had turned tender—one could pick them up and chew them directly, with the flavor intensifying the more they chewed.

The salted fish was rich in taste, while the porridge was mild. Taking a bite of salted fish followed by a sip of porridge, the combination preserved both the sweetness of the rice and the savory depth of the fish—a perfect harmony of flavors.

Once they started eating, Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou couldn’t stop. They drank two large bowls of porridge before finally wiping their mouths with satisfaction. Seeing their frenzied eating, the tall and handsome man naturally wouldn’t miss out on the feast. Though he appeared elegant, he swiftly scooped up a bowl of porridge, grabbed a generous portion of pickled vegetables, and finished off the remaining salted fish. Still unsatisfied, he poured the fish sauce and fermented black beans into a bowl of noodles, slurping it all down.

Xiao Zhu was dumbfounded. He had never expected these three men to have such enormous appetites. It was fortunate that they hadn’t agreed to stay as guards, or else their caravan would have been eaten into bankruptcy.

“Damn, this is the life!” After breakfast, Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou lay on a large rock, rubbing their bellies with satisfied expressions.

“Rest for a while, then we’ll set off. We should reach the capital the day after tomorrow,” the tall and handsome man said. He still stood straight as a rod, his lean waist and abdomen as flat as ever, as if he hadn’t eaten at all.

“Got it!” The two burly men readily agreed. Just then, one of Lin the shopkeeper’s servants came running out of the forest, carrying two wild rabbits and a hazel grouse. Excitedly, he shouted, “Shopkeeper! The traps and nets we set last night caught some game. We’ve got lunch sorted!”

“What did you catch?” Lin Dan lifted the curtain of the carriage and, upon seeing the game, chuckled lightly. “Great, we’ll have braised rabbit and stir-fried hazel grouse for lunch. Hazel grouse meat is delicate and is known as the ‘dragon meat of the sky.’ No matter how it’s cooked, it’s always delicious. First, chop the grouse meat, young ginger, pickled chili, and preserved mustard greens into small pieces. Stir-fry them in sequence, then add half a bowl of clear broth and simmer briefly. This method keeps the grouse tender, allowing the marrow from the chopped bones to blend with the tangy, spicy broth. The dish doesn’t even need thickening—it’s already packed with flavor. Served with white rice, it’s an absolute delight.”

As Lin Dan described the dish, the recently full group found themselves swallowing hard once more, wishing time would pass faster so that noon would come sooner.

“Keep the rabbits and hazel grouse caged for now. Let’s get on the road,” Lin Dan said, turning to the three burly men with a gentle voice. “Brothers, this is where we part ways. Thank you for your care along the journey.”

“You’re too polite, Shopkeeper Lin.” Zhao Liu hurriedly swallowed his saliva, smiling awkwardly.

“Farewell,” the tall and handsome man said, mounting his horse and giving a slight nod.

Luo Tietou took off his boots, pretending to check for small stones inside, but his eyes were sneakily fixed on the rabbits and hazel grouse, clearly plotting something.

Lin Dan gave a respectful bow before slowly departing.

Luo Tietou took his time putting his boots back on, then mounted his steed and said with feigned concern, “Boss, why don’t we escort Shopkeeper Lin a bit further? The road ahead is full of dense forests and dangerous terrain—there could be bandits. Her servants are all southerners, small and frail. How could they possibly protect five full carts of goods?”

“Tietou is right. Shopkeeper Lin is a good person, and she’s just a weak woman. We’ve completed our mission anyway, so it wouldn’t hurt to escort her a bit longer,” Zhao Liu quickly chimed in.

The tall man turned his horse and looked at the caravan. After a brief pause, he made the decision. “Then let’s follow them.”

The three men whipped their horses and quickly caught up, explaining their intentions through the carriage curtain. Shopkeeper Lin was naturally grateful, but Xiao Zhu’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

These three gluttons—could it be that they saw the wild rabbits and hazel grouse and just wanted to stick around for another meal?



=====================================

Chapter 11: The Cook (10)
At noon, as expected, everyone feasted on stir-fried hazel grouse and braised rabbit. There were nine people in total, and ordinarily, the food wouldn’t have been enough. However, Manager Lin’s culinary skills were exceptional—both dishes were bursting with flavor. A single spoonful of food mixed with rice was completely satisfying. After the meal, a layer of bright red sauce remained in the serving bowls. Luo Tietou and Zhao Liu quickly took out their steamed buns, dipping them bit by bit until the sauce was gone.

"Comfortable, really comfortable!" Luo Tietou lay on the grass, rubbing his belly. If every mission could be accompanied by Manager Lin, he’d be willing to travel all year round. That wouldn’t be hardship—it would be luxury.

"One hazel grouse is still a bit too little, not quite enough. How about we go hunt a few more later so Manager Lin can cook again tonight?" Zhao Liu suggested in a low voice.

"Sounds good to me. Since we’ve already hunted them, even if Manager Lin doesn’t like repeating dishes, she’ll have to make an exception. Wild game is best when freshly killed and cooked—that’s when it tastes the best." Luo Tietou smacked his lips, still savoring the taste of lunch.

The tall, handsome man cast them a glance but said nothing, clearly giving silent approval.

After resting for half an hour, the convoy resumed its journey. As they passed through a dense forest, Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou heard small animals scurrying through the underbrush. Without hesitation, they grabbed their bows and chased after them. They were determined to hunt more game for a hearty dinner.

The tall man merely glanced back but did not follow. A short while later, he sensed something was wrong. Just as he was about to instruct the driver to slow down, an arrow shot out of nowhere, striking one of the horses pulling the carriage. The sudden attack startled the rest of the horses, causing chaos. Some reared up while others neighed frantically, sending the convoy into disarray. Fortunately, the driver managed to rein them in and calm them down—otherwise, Manager Lin would have suffered a major loss.

But just because the goods were unharmed didn’t mean the situation was under control. Suddenly, more than a dozen burly men emerged from the thick forest, wielding machetes and bows—clearly a band of seasoned bandits.

The tall man immediately moved closer to Manager Lin’s carriage, speaking in a low voice, "Don’t resist. Go with them for now. Zhao Liu and Tietou are still behind us—they’ll find a way to rescue us." Though he was highly skilled in martial arts and could take on a dozen bandits without issue, there were too many people in the convoy for him to protect them all.

Lin Dan tapped her fingers against the carriage window, signaling her understanding.

The entire convoy, along with the carriages, was taken up the mountain. At the top, there was a small, crude bandit stronghold—five or six earthen houses enclosed by wooden fences. It was clear that the bandits had hastily built the settlement while on the run. Though it was still small in scale, if left unchecked for three to five years, it would surely become a major threat to the region.

Lin Dan's hands were tied as she stumbled forward, all the while silently counting the number of bandits. Judging by the size of the houses and what she had observed along the way, this was a small gang of around thirty men. Several kidnapped women were also present, forced to do labor with blank, numb expressions.

After being led into the largest earthen house, a fierce-looking bandit strode over and gruffly asked, "Did we get anything good this time?"

"Damn it, just some pickled vegetables and dried goods—not worth a single coin!" One of the bandits spat before adding, "But at least we got three fine young women. The brothers will have a good time tonight!"

The bandit leader, initially disappointed, quickly broke into a lecherous grin when he saw Lin Dan and the other two women. "Good, good! Their skin may not be the fairest, but those figures are quite something!"

Having traveled extensively, Lin Dan had a well-toned physique. Her slender waist was tightly cinched with a cloth belt, accentuating her ample chest and curvaceous hips. Unlike the frail, sickly beauty that was fashionable at the time, her robust charm was uniquely alluring. She remained calm in the face of danger, but her servants erupted in furious curses. Their defiance earned them gagged mouths and a rough beating.

The tall man lifted his gaze to the bandit leader, his eyes flashing with a dangerous glint.

Lin Dan cast her companions a reassuring look before speaking slowly, "Perhaps the chief is unaware, but my ancestors were imperial chefs. I learned a few skills from my father. If the chief is willing to release my servants, I would be happy to stay and cook for your men."

She had no illusions that these ruthless bandits would actually release anyone. Her true intent was to divert their attention. To ordinary folk, an imperial chef was someone they could only dream of meeting. If she could spark their curiosity, she could buy more time. And with time, there would be a chance to escape.

"You're an imperial chef?" The bandit leader's lecherous grin faded, replaced by intrigue.

"My master’s master was an imperial chef, and my father once served as the head chef for the Yongding Marquis' household," Lin Dan explained.

Hearing this, the bandit leader’s gaze changed. Both the emperor and the Yongding Marquis were figures beyond the reach of commoners. He pondered for a moment before saying, "How do I know you're telling the truth? As it happens, we recently stole two cows. If you can butcher them and prepare a meal that satisfies us, I’ll consider releasing your people."

"Then I must thank the chief in advance," Lin Dan said with a bow. "Butchering a cow is hard work. May I have my two handmaids to assist me?"

Slaughtering a cow was a dirty, labor-intensive job, and the bandits had no interest in doing it themselves. Since the two maids were still young—only twelve or thirteen years old—and posed no real threat, the bandits quickly agreed. The rest of the captives were tied up and thrown into the woodshed.

Once the bandits were gone, Xiao Zhu wriggled over to the tall man like a worm and whispered, "Big brother, do you think Zhao Liu and Tietou will find our trail? When will they get here?"

The man lay quietly on the ground, eyes slightly closed, his voice low and steady. "They will find us. Wait until nightfall."

Xiao Zhu was still anxious, staring out the window and murmuring, "I wonder how Manager Lin and the others are doing."

At that moment, Lin Dan was crouched down, carefully sharpening a knife. Every so often, she tested the blade's sharpness with her fingertip, her expression focused. Two bandits initially kept a close watch on her, but seeing that she was only tending the fire, boiling water, and sharpening her knife—without whispering with her maids or surveying the surroundings—they gradually lowered their guard and sat aside to chat.

The two cows were well-fed and healthy, clearly stolen from a farm in the valley.

After finishing her preparations, Lin Dan circled the cows a few times, running her hands over their bodies as if selecting her target. Seeing that she was finally about to start, the two bandits gathered around to watch, sneering in amusement. But their laughter soon froze.

Lin Dan picked a cow, had her maids blindfold the other one to keep it calm, and then, with one swift motion, drove her knife deep into the selected cow’s throat, severing its carotid artery. She immediately stepped back, took a ladle of water, and casually rinsed the blood off her blade.

Just five meters away, the robust farm cow collapsed silently, unable to even let out a cry as a torrent of blood gushed from its throat, quickly staining the ground.

The two bandits were dumbfounded. Lin Dan, unfazed, continued to work—scalding the hide, scraping off the hair, and burning away any remaining bristles with a red-hot iron rod. The stench of searing flesh filled the air, sending shivers down their spines.

By the time she finished skinning and butchering the cow, the bandits no longer dared to underestimate her.

"How many people are in this camp?" Lin Dan casually asked while washing her hands.

"Why do you want to know?" The bandits, now wary, shot her a guarded look.

"I need to know how many people there are so I can cook accordingly. If I prepare too little, it won't be enough for everyone." Lin Dan wiped a few blood splatters off her face with a handkerchief, her expression utterly calm.

This was a perfectly reasonable explanation. The two bandits mentally counted and replied, "There are about twenty to thirty mouths to feed. Cook a bit more."

Lin Dan nodded without further questioning. She and the two young girls carried the beef into the kitchen, cutting it into two-inch cubes before marinating it with soy sauce, cooking wine, and special salt. She then processed the ox hooves, brisket, ribs, and bones, setting them aside for later use.

"Master, how are we going to escape?" One of the young girls couldn't hold back any longer and whispered anxiously in her ear.

"Let's finish this meal first," Lin Dan replied, calmly peeling garlic.

No matter how anxious they felt, the two girls could do nothing but accept their fate and focus on washing the vegetables.

An hour later, the beef had finished marinating. Lin Dan poured half a jar of vegetable oil into a large wok, heated it until it reached about eighty percent of its smoking point, then slowly added the beef. She stir-fried the meat, flipping it skillfully until it was half-cooked before setting it aside. She discarded the excess oil, washed the wok, and added fresh oil. Once heated, she sautéed ginger slices and scallions until fragrant before returning the beef to the pot. Then, she added soy sauce, star anise, and other seasonings, continuing to stir-fry for another fifteen minutes. Finally, she poured in water and let it come to a boil before reducing the heat, carefully adjusting the firewood to keep it at a slow simmer.

With the braised beef nearly done, Lin Dan turned her attention to the ox tendons, washing and cutting them into strips before frying them in hot oil. She was preparing another dish—red-braised beef tendons.

The two young girls were completely in awe by now. They had never expected their master to focus so intently on cooking even in the middle of a bandit den. They couldn't help but wonder—was her life more important, or was making a good meal?


===================================================

Chapter 12: The Cook (11)
By the time the beef had been simmering for a while, a rich aroma was already wafting from the pot, making the two bandits restless. They circled around the stove, occasionally wiping away drool, and impatiently asked, “It’s been fifteen minutes already—shouldn’t it be ready to eat?”

“It’s still too early. It needs to simmer for at least another half an hour to become tender,” Lin Dan wiped her hands with a cloth and added, “Could you take me to my carriage? I need to fetch some seasoning.”

The two bandits immediately became wary. Pointing at the bottles and jars on the stove, they snapped, “There’s plenty of seasoning here already! Isn’t that enough for you?”

Lin Dan remained calm and explained gently, “This dish is missing a key ingredient that will make it truly flavorful. You can escort me there and back—I’m just a weak woman, do you really think I could escape from you? If I add this seasoning, the beef stew will taste several times better than it does now.”

The bandits inhaled the tantalizing aroma in the air and hesitated. If it could be even more delicious than this, just how good would it be? They were already aware that this imperial chef’s skills were beyond ordinary, and recalling the ease with which she slaughtered the cow earlier, they felt a bit uneasy.

Seeing their hesitation, Lin Dan took the initiative to tie a rope around her own wrists. Only then did the two reluctantly nod in agreement. Before leaving, they locked the kitchen door to prevent Peony and Azalea from escaping.

The three of them walked to the innermost part of the stronghold, winding through hidden paths until they reached a cave covered with thick vines. Without guidance, one might easily overlook it.

The bandits pulled aside the vines and barked, “Get in there and be quick about it!”

Lin Dan peered inside by the light of their torches and saw that her five carriages were indeed parked within the cave. Alongside them were dozens of large, locked chests—clearly stolen loot. Without wasting time, she climbed into one of the carriages, broke the seal on a large clay jar, scooped a few ladles of liquor into a small empty jug, and swiftly resealed the jar with parchment paper, tying it tightly with rope.

She moved quickly, completing the process in mere seconds, but the bandits still caught a whiff of the indescribably rich aroma of the liquor. The intoxicating scent made them feel slightly dizzy.

“What kind of liquor is this? How can it smell so incredible?” one of them asked, swallowing hard.

“It’s just ordinary homemade liquor, nothing special,” Lin Dan replied stiffly, her gaze evasive.

The two bandits gave her a long, suspicious look but said nothing more, leading her back to the kitchen.

Upon returning, Lin Dan poured the liquor into the simmering beef stew and gently stirred it with a spatula. The already rich broth thickened even more, becoming glossy and luscious. Each chunk of beef was now coated in a glistening, velvety sauce. A strange yet irresistible fragrance filled the air, piercing through the kitchen’s doors and windows, drifting across the entire stronghold, and leaving everyone utterly mesmerized.

“Hurry up! Scoop out some beef for us!” The bandits guarding Lin Dan banged their empty bowls impatiently.

“The meat isn’t tender enough yet. It needs a bit more time,” Lin Dan kindly explained.

“We don’t care if it’s tender! As long as it’s cooked, that’s good enough! Just give us some, now!” The two bandits were so desperate that their eyes turned red. That tantalizing aroma drove them mad with hunger, making them wish they could dive headfirst into the pot.

The other bandits also rushed over, demanding a taste. If not for the bandit leader maintaining order, the kitchen would have been ransacked already.

“What the hell did that woman put in the pot? How can it smell this good?” the bandit leader muttered after leaving the kitchen. He grabbed one of his subordinates and interrogated him while sniffing the lingering aroma in the air.

“Boss, let’s go check it out,” one of the bandits suggested eagerly. “There’s still a while before the food is ready—why don’t we have some drinks first?”

“Good idea! Bring the liquor out!”

A group of them carried the large clay jar to the main hall, removed the parchment cover, and took a deep breath. Immediately, their heads spun.

No wonder—the fragrance of this liquor was overwhelming. It was more potent than the strongest firewater, yet richer and more refined than the finest aged wines. They hadn’t even taken a sip, yet their mouths were already watering uncontrollably.

“Fill my bowl—now!” the bandit leader barked impatiently.

He grabbed a large bowl, gulped down the liquor, froze for a moment, and then burst into hearty laughter, showering it with praise. The other bandits couldn’t resist either, each taking a bowl and drinking deeply. The rich aroma spread through the air, luring more people over…

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhu and the others, who had been discussing their escape plan and how to rescue their master, suddenly caught a whiff of an indescribably rich, meaty fragrance. They immediately fell silent.

Then, with absolute certainty, they declared, “The boss is making rice wine-braised beef!”

“I’m starving…” one of the servants murmured, licking his lips.

The others exchanged glances, their stomachs growling in unison. Whenever their boss cooked, even those who weren’t hungry would suddenly feel ravenous.

Even the man who had been meditating with his eyes closed opened them and looked toward the kitchen, his Adam’s apple bobbing involuntarily.

Just as they were about to resume their escape discussion, an overpowering wave of liquor aroma rolled in from all directions, making their eyes burn with desperation.

Xiao Zhu, who had remained composed through their capture, beatings, and imprisonment, finally lost his cool. He spat harshly and cursed, “Damn those thunder-struck bastards! How dare they steal our liquor?!”

The handsome and silent man suddenly asked, "What kind of wine is this?"

Xiaozhu gritted his teeth and said, "Have you ever heard the legend from Zhongshan County—when Liu Xuanshi bought wine from a Zhongshan tavern..."

The man, well-versed in knowledge, immediately continued, "Xuanshi got drunk… The Thousand-Day Wine?"

Xiaozhu glanced at him in surprise and nodded. "That's right, this wine is the legendary Thousand-Day Wine. Shopkeeper Lin traveled through Zhongshan County for three years, visiting various places, and finally managed to recreate the recipe for Thousand-Day Wine. After successfully brewing it, she buried it underground for seven years. It was just recently unearthed and was intended to be sold in the capital for a good price. When the jar was opened, a wine bug had already formed inside. The wine is extremely rich and thick—though it may not make one sleep for a thousand days, it can still render someone drunk for three days and three nights."

"The Drunken Xuanshi" is a story passed down for hundreds of years. It tells of a man named Di Xi from Zhongshan County, whose brewing skills were unparalleled. A wine enthusiast named Liu Xuanshi visited him to buy wine. Di Xi sold him a jar but forgot to warn him that the wine had an extremely strong aftereffect and should be consumed in moderation—otherwise, one could sleep for a thousand days. Liu Xuanshi drank heartily and passed out upon returning home. His family, thinking he had died, buried him. A thousand days later, Di Xi suddenly remembered this incident and rushed to find him. The Liu family then unearthed Liu Xuanshi, who had just woken up, still exuding a strong wine aroma. Those who smelled it also fell into a deep sleep for three months.

In later generations, this wine became known as Thousand-Day Wine, regarded as the true celestial drink.

With the rich wine aroma filling the air and the rowdy shouts of mountain bandits playing drinking games echoing in his ears, the handsome man licked his dry lips and gritted his teeth. "They really are a bunch of beasts!" As soon as he finished speaking, he forcefully broke free from his bindings and stood up, his face dark as ink. He had originally planned to wait until midnight to take action, but now he couldn't hold back any longer.

"You—you—you… How did you untie yourself?" Xiaozhu and the others stared at him in shock.

"Stay here for now. I'll go rescue Shopkeeper Lin. When you hear the whistle, come out and meet me." To prevent them from running around and alerting the bandits, the man made sure to untie them and gave them a warning. He then tore apart the iron chain on the door latch with his bare hands, restored it slightly, and stealthily made his way toward the direction where the aroma of meat was the strongest.

Lin Dan was stir-frying beef tendons while Shaoyao and Dujuan were shaping pounded beef into meatballs and dropping them into a milky broth made from beef bones. When the man pushed the door open and entered, the three of them were momentarily stunned. However, Lin Dan reacted the fastest—she immediately pulled him inside and swiftly shut the door behind him.

"Why are you here? What about Xiaozhu and the others?" she asked in a hushed voice.

"I'm here to rescue you," the man replied steadily while selecting kitchen knives from the counter, as his weapons had been confiscated by the bandits. "I'll get you out of the stronghold first. Once you're in the forest, don't run around. Follow the stream downstream and wait for me in an open area at the foot of the mountain. Xiaozhu and the others will come with me later." The upcoming scene would be quite bloody—not suitable for women to witness. Xiaozhu and the others could be rescued last; they could even help clean up the bodies.

With that thought in mind, the man reached out to grab Lin Dan's wrist, but she gently pushed him away. "There are over thirty vicious bandits here. You're alone—how could you possibly handle them all? Sit down and eat something. We’ll be able to leave soon." As she spoke, she brought him a plate of stir-fried beef with scallions and shoved a bowl and chopsticks into his hands.

The man instinctively took the bowl and chopsticks and wolfed down a few bites. His eyes flickered with satisfaction and enjoyment, but he quickly froze and stiffened. He said awkwardly, "This isn't the time to eat. You must leave with me now!"

"Leave? Sit down and eat!" Lin Dan lightly slapped his outstretched hand away, her voice carrying a soft chuckle.

The man glanced at his slightly tingling hand, then at Lin Dan’s bright, smiling face. He fell silent and lowered his gaze.

Shaoyao and Dujuan, looking at the half-empty pot of stewed beef, complained, "We told them the meat wasn’t fully tender yet and needed more time to simmer, but they insisted on scooping it out. Such a waste!"

"As long as they’re only wasting food and not lives, that’s already fortunate." Lin Dan tilted her head, listening closely, and her smile deepened. "The noise has stopped. Let’s go take a look."

The man immediately put down his bowl and stood up, only to be pressed back down by Lin Dan. "You sit. We’ll go." With that, she and the two young girls each carried a plate of hot dishes and strolled outside at a leisurely pace. Even if they encountered the bandits, they could use the excuse of serving food to cover their tracks—there was nothing to be afraid of.

The man touched his shoulder, his expression somewhat peculiar, then quickly followed them.

They reached the main hall without incident, only to find the floor covered with unconscious bandits. Some had collapsed onto the tables, snoring thunderously. The air was thick with an intoxicating wine aroma, so strong that it almost physically pressed against them the moment they stepped through the door. Loud snores echoed from several other buildings as well, proving that the bandits had ultimately succumbed to the allure of the Thousand-Day Wine and were now completely incapacitated.

Shaoyao and Dujuan tiptoed over to peek at the large wine jar in the center of the hall, gritting their teeth in anger. "They drank the entire jar!"

Lin Dan patted their heads and repeated the same words, "As long as they didn’t harm anyone, that’s all that matters. Let’s pack up and leave."

The man looked at the drunken bandits sprawled all over the ground, astonished. He never imagined that without a single fight, Lin Dan had already resolved everything—there was no need for anyone to save her.

Lin Dan walked past him and said leisurely, "In my world, there’s nothing that a good meal can’t fix."
