Chapter 3.1

The male protagonist and the female protagonist hadn’t even exchanged a single word, let alone been together, and the second world had already completely broken free from the control of the Main God. When Zhou Yunsheng returned to the Starsea Space, he discovered that his soul power had become even stronger than before, and he vaguely realized—whenever he disrupted a space, he would absorb the power contained within it.

This method of sustaining life was identical to that of the Main God. Perhaps one day, when his power surpassed the Main God’s, he would be able to break free from these shackles and return to reality.

However, this speculation did not excite Zhou Yunsheng. On the contrary, he greatly enjoyed every moment of opposing the Main God.

Because the energy he absorbed was too vast, he fell into a dormant state. When he woke up again, two brand-new galaxies had appeared in the Starsea Space.

Zhou Yunsheng stood amidst the galaxies for a long time before finally pressing the teleportation button. When he opened his eyes again, he found himself sitting in a simple cubicle, with no one around. In front of him was a small wooden desk, upon which lay a blank sheet of white paper, a brush, and an inkstone.

Had he arrived in ancient times? He tugged at the luxurious brocade robe he was wearing and then clicked on the smart device on his wrist. A brief description of this world and detailed information about the original owner appeared on the screen.

This was the Gongyuan (examination hall) of the Great Zhou Dynasty, and it was currently the triennial Spring Imperial Examination. The original owner had successfully passed the prefectural, county, academy, and provincial examinations, reaching the metropolitan examination. If he passed, he would qualify for the final palace examination.

The original owner was named Shen Yibin, the legitimate eldest son of Shen Hui, Minister of Personnel. He was usually gluttonous and lazy, with mediocre scholarly abilities. The fact that he had managed to pass all the previous exams and reach the metropolitan examination was actually thanks to the female protagonist of this world.

The female protagonist was named Xie Yurou, a side concubine of the Seventh Prince, Zhu Ziqing. In her previous life, she had died tragically in the Cold Palace, but now she had been reborn and had obtained a miraculous medical space and a spiritual spring that could cure all diseases and enhance beauty.

Shen Yibin’s legitimate sister, Shen Qiaodan, was also a side concubine of the Seventh Prince. In their past life, she was Xie Yurou’s mortal enemy. After giving birth to the prince’s eldest legitimate son, she outshone Xie Yurou and became the main wife. When the Seventh Prince ascended the throne, her son was made the crown prince, and she became the empress. As the loser in their rivalry, Xie Yurou was repeatedly demoted and eventually died of illness in the Cold Palace. It was only before her death that she discovered her long-term infertility was Shen Qiaodan’s doing.

Logically speaking, after being reborn, Xie Yurou should have sought revenge against the Shen family. Why, then, would she secretly help Shen Yibin? Naturally, this was all part of a scheme.

With knowledge of future events, Xie Yurou had someone leak the exam questions to Shen Yibin, allowing him to pass all the previous exams and reach the metropolitan examination. However, this year’s examination would be embroiled in a major cheating scandal—the emperor’s personal eunuch had recorded the exam questions and sold them outside the palace. The crown prince’s retainers saw this as an excellent opportunity for profit and collaborated in taking massive bribes.

The examinees who obtained the exam questions in advance, eager to ensure a high ranking, spent large sums of money hiring talented scholars to compose essays for them. They memorized the essays before the exam and simply transcribed them once inside the examination hall. As a result, this year’s metropolitan examination produced numerous stunningly eloquent essays, greatly pleasing Emperor Tianchen.

The problem, however, lay in the fact that there were only so many truly talented individuals available. Since multiple examinees sought help from the same scholars, identical essays inevitably appeared.

After discovering seven or eight identical exam papers in a row, Emperor Tianchen’s delight turned into fury. He immediately ordered the Minister of Personnel to work with the Court of Judicial Review to investigate the matter.

That year, all examinees who had purchased the exam questions were stripped of their qualifications and sent back to their hometowns. Many noble sons in the capital were involved, leading to their fathers being dismissed from office by the emperor and permanently barred from holding official positions. This marked the beginning of the crown prince’s downfall and provided the Seventh Prince with an opportunity to seize the throne.

In the previous life, Shen Yibin had never even passed the preliminary county-level exam, let alone the metropolitan examination. His father, Shen Hui, had gained favor with the emperor by uncovering the cheating scandal and eventually rose to the position of Grand Chancellor, wielding immense power. Without Shen Hui’s support, the Seventh Prince would not have been able to elevate Shen Qiaodan to the position of main wife.

In this life, however, Xie Yurou secretly assisted Shen Yibin in passing all the previous exams, just to ensure that he would participate in this year’s metropolitan examination and then be stripped of his qualifications—thus ruining Shen Hui’s political career.

Without the Shen family’s influence, Shen Qiaodan would no longer be a threat.

Zhou Yunsheng had arrived neither too early nor too late—he appeared just as Shen Yibin had purchased the exam questions, memorized the answers, and was about to begin writing. Now, he had only two choices.

One was to forfeit the exam and leave early. However, the crown prince’s retainers possessed a ledger that recorded the names of all examinees who had bought the questions. Even if he submitted a blank paper, he would still be implicated once the ledger was exposed.

The second option was to abandon the memorized essay and write a groundbreaking, awe-inspiring answer.

Emperor Tianchen was desperate for talent. He had once spent a fortune acquiring a good horse and even greater sums recruiting brilliant minds. If someone was truly a learned scholar, the emperor might be willing to overlook the scandal.

But just how exceptional would an essay have to be to impress the emperor and avoid disaster?

As Zhou Yunsheng pondered, he glanced at the exam paper. The question was surprisingly simple—just three characters: "Zuyongdiao" (the tax system). It was indeed characteristic of Emperor Tianchen’s straightforward, pragmatic, and sharp examination style.

Zuyongdiao was the current taxation system of the Great Zhou Dynasty, based on the Equal-Field System. However, due to increasing land annexation, a growing number of independent farmers were going bankrupt, fleeing, or becoming tenant farmers under landlords, pushing the Equal-Field System to the brink of collapse. With its foundation crumbling, the Zuyongdiao tax system was also in peril.

It not only increased the burden on the common people, leading to widespread hardship, but also failed to generate sufficient revenue to sustain government operations. Emperor Tianchen was currently troubled over how to reform the tax system.

Zhou Yunsheng was well-versed in literature, calligraphy, chess, and music, and with the powerful search engine of his smart device, composing a masterpiece was effortless. He simply closed his eyes briefly, and when he reopened them, his brush moved fluidly, creating bold and powerful strokes that penetrated the paper.

What was even more astonishing than the calligraphy itself was the content of the essay—not only did it analyze the flaws of the Zuyongdiao system, but it also proposed a more advanced Two-Tax Law.

This new system abandoned the old method of taxing individuals and instead levied taxes based on property, establishing the principle of “taxing assets rather than people.” It not only increased government revenue but also alleviated the tax burden on the people. This reform laid the foundation for future taxation systems and was a significant milestone in history.

After completing his essay, Zhou Yunsheng briefly reviewed it before closing his eyes to recall Shen Yibin’s life. In the previous life, Shen Yibin was stripped of his titles and banned from future examinations, while his father, Shen Hui, was dismissed, leading to the rapid decline of the Shen family. Meanwhile, Xie Yurou rose to power, eventually becoming the Empress Dowager.

Now, not only did Zhou Yunsheng have to help Shen Yibin avoid this crisis, but he also had to turn the tide and restore the Shen family’s glory.

So how should he proceed? Should he assist the Seventh Prince and claim the merit of supporting the future emperor?

Zhou Yunsheng shook his head slightly, dismissing the idea. Instead of letting Xie Yurou benefit, why not support a different prince?


The Tianchen Emperor had twelve sons, but he favored the crown prince the most, as he was both the eldest and the legitimate heir. Perhaps having been flattered and elevated too high, the crown prince had become increasingly reckless in recent years. This corruption case marked the beginning of the emperor’s waning patience with him.

If the crown prince could steady himself, regaining the emperor’s favor would not be difficult. And if that were the case, how could the other princes have any chance to rise? The question was whether he could still be saved. It would be best to observe first—if he was beyond redemption, then another candidate would have to be found.

With these thoughts in mind, Zhou Yunsheng unknowingly drifted off to sleep, causing the patrolling officials to shake their heads in disapproval.

After the metropolitan examination, the chief examiners worked tirelessly day and night to grade the papers. Since this year’s examination questions pertained to the fate of the nation, the Tianchen Emperor, while testing the scholars, also sought to gather insights. Thus, he personally visited the examination hall to inspect the papers.

One of the chief examiners presented a paper with a deep bow and said, "Your Majesty, please take a look. This essay is worthy of the top rank!"

"I too have an exceptional one here," another examiner offered as he presented a different paper.

The Tianchen Emperor took both papers and, with just a brief glance, was full of praise.

While he was reviewing them, the examiners continued their grading. Suddenly, one of them accidentally knocked over an inkstone, his face filled with horror.

"What is the matter?" The emperor turned to him slowly.

"Your Majesty, this paper… it is identical to the one before!" The examiner’s face turned ashen, fully aware that this meant the exam questions had been leaked, and someone had arranged for answers to be written on behalf of multiple candidates.

The emperor’s eyes darkened. He quickly scanned through the essay and spoke with an unprecedented coldness, "Find them—bring me all the identical papers at once!"

The examiners dared not delay and immediately began searching through the stack of papers. It did not take long before they uncovered eight or nine identical essays. Just then, another examiner picked up a paper and stared at it in stunned silence, his fingers trembling slightly.

Seeing this, the emperor strode over. His face was clouded with fury, ready for a storm—but after reading just two lines, he was completely taken aback. As he continued reading, his expression changed from shock to delight, and by the end, he was so overjoyed that he slapped the table and laughed aloud.

"Good! Good! Good! I never expected that our Great Zhou would produce such a prodigious talent, and that I would be fortunate enough to witness it! This is truly a blessing!"

In his excitement, the emperor disregarded protocol and directly unsealed the anonymous submission to check the candidate’s name—Shen Yibin?

Shen Yibin? The name sounded familiar.

"Your Majesty, Shen Yibin is the eldest legitimate son of Lord Shen Hui," an examiner answered, ending with a sigh.

This young man was infamous in the capital for his lack of discipline and learning. If he were truly capable of composing such a masterpiece, then all the other scholars might as well hang themselves in shame. It had to be another case of someone writing the essay on his behalf.

The emperor had the same thought as the examiners. His face darkened instantly, and he ordered in a stern voice, "Arrest Shen Yibin immediately! Find out who wrote the essay for him!"



======================================================


Chapter 3.2
Shen Yibin was the only legitimate son of the Shen family and was therefore highly favored. Everything he ate, wore, and used was of the finest quality available. After returning to the Shen household, Zhou Yunsheng enjoyed a few carefree and comfortable days, but little did he expect that one morning, he would be thrown into the imperial prison by the Imperial Guards.

Shen’s father, being a close minister of the emperor, naturally had access to the examination questions. Emperor Tianchen suspected that Shen’s father was also involved in the cheating scandal and ordered the Imperial Guards to detain him as well.

Now, father and son sat together in a foul-smelling prison cell, their faces pale and haggard, with dark circles under their eyes, looking utterly exhausted.

"When is Mother bringing us food? I haven’t had Eight-Treasure Duck in so long, and I’m craving it badly." Zhou Yunsheng held a piece of straw between his lips while rubbing his backside, which had just been caned. Fortunately, he had always maintained a habit of strengthening his body, or he would have suffered internal injuries by now.

Shen’s father, still holding his official position and thus exempt from physical punishment, suffered mentally far worse than any beating. He grabbed his son’s ear and scolded angrily, "You unfilial son! How can you still think about food at a time like this? Just confess the name of the person who wrote the exam for you and spare yourself further suffering!"

"But I wrote it myself. How can I confess to something that never happened?" Zhou Yunsheng covered his ear, looking aggrieved.

Seeing his son still refusing to admit fault even in such dire straits, Shen’s father was overwhelmed with fury and began beating him soundly.

Meanwhile, Madam Shen was visiting her daughter, who was the concubine of the Seventh Prince.

"Mother, you should leave. I am barely able to protect myself now—how can I possibly save Father and my brother? I’ve already sent people to request an audience several times, but the Seventh Prince refuses to see me. He must have guessed my intentions, for he even had Mother Consort summon me to the palace for a harsh reprimand. I am now under house arrest, and who knows when I’ll be free again?" Shen Qiaodan wept bitterly, her face full of despair.

Madam Shen suddenly understood. After a moment of silence, she sighed. "So, the Seventh Prince intends to stand by and do nothing? It makes sense—your brother will never amount to anything, and your father’s career is ruined. The Shen family is now of no use to him. My daughter, you have no children and have lost favor. What will become of you in the future? If I had known this would happen, I would have married you off to an ordinary family for a peaceful life."

Mother and daughter, overwhelmed by sorrow, embraced each other and cried.

In the western courtyard, Xie Yurou had someone eavesdrop on their conversation. After dismissing the servant who reported back, she sneered, "Now that the Shen family has fallen, what future does Shen Qiaodan have? Hard times are just beginning for her—she should take her time and enjoy them."

Her maids were all extremely loyal, standing with lowered heads and blank expressions, pretending they had heard nothing.

At that moment, the Seventh Prince entered. Upon seeing the stunning beauty reclining on the couch, his usually indifferent gaze softened into a gentle smile.

"Ziqing, Madam Shen was here. Shouldn't you..." Xie Yurou maintained her usual gentle and kind demeanor, naturally inclined to plead for mercy.

"Say no more. Father is furious, and no one can persuade him. The Shen family must fend for themselves." The Seventh Prince’s expression turned cold for a brief moment. He understood the value of aiding others in times of crisis, but Shen Yibin was incompetent, and the only capable member of the Shen family, Shen Hui, had already lost his political future. The Shen family was simply not worth supporting.

Seeing his reaction, Xie Yurou said no more. She lifted her handkerchief to her lips, smiling discreetly.

After leaving the Seventh Prince’s residence, Madam Shen bought freshly roasted Eight-Treasure Duck from the Shi Jin Restaurant and took it to the imperial prison for her husband and son. The three of them sat together in silence.

"So, our family has officially been abandoned by the Seventh Prince?" After a long while, Shen’s father sighed deeply.

Madam Shen nodded, and tears streamed down her face again.

Zhou Yunsheng, having just finished a bowl of hot rice and a duck leg, finally spoke with satisfaction, "He now favors Concubine Xie and has cast my sister aside, even going as far as to reprimand her multiple times. It’s better that he’s abandoned us—at least we won’t end up helping him gain power only for Concubine Xie to reap all the benefits."

Lowering his voice, he whispered, "Father, why don’t we pledge allegiance to another master?"

Shen’s father trembled with rage, his beard quivering. He slammed his son’s head into the food box and roared, "Allegiance? We can’t even save our own lives, and you’re already thinking about this? Where do you get such bold ideas?!"

Zhou Yunsheng struggled free from his father’s grip, his face now covered in rice grains. He shouted towards the outside, "I confess! I am willing to confess! But I must see the Emperor first—if not, I’ll bash my head against the wall and die!"

Since the Emperor was eager to find the true author of the essay, he had been inquiring about it multiple times daily. However, Shen Yibin was stubborn, enduring severe beatings without revealing a word. The Deputy Minister of Justice was under immense pressure, so when he heard that Zhou Yunsheng was finally willing to confess, he immediately sent someone to inform the Emperor.

Gaining a brilliant minister in exchange for just one meeting, Emperor Tianchen readily agreed.

The father and son were brought before the Emperor and knelt down to pay their respects.

"Who is the person? Where does he live?" Emperor Tianchen asked impatiently.

"Your Majesty, that person is neither far away nor unknown—he is none other than myself," Zhou Yunsheng replied, his face still smudged with grains of rice, looking utterly disheveled.

The Emperor’s expression darkened instantly.

Zhou Yunsheng quickly added, "Your Majesty, I began speaking at eight months old, composing poetry at three, and have always been gifted with exceptional intelligence and a prodigious memory. I have read extensively and possess profound knowledge. That policy essay was indeed my own work—please, Your Majesty, see the truth!"

No one knew Shen Yibin’s capabilities better than his own father. Hearing his son boast so brazenly, Shen’s father wished he could rush over and shut his mouth. However, considering they were in the Qinzheng Hall, before the Emperor himself, he dared not act rashly.

The Emperor listened with amusement before throwing a copy of Huainanzi at him and commanding sternly, "You have one quarter of an hour to read this. Then, you must recite it word for word. If you make a single mistake, you will be executed immediately."

Shen’s father broke into a cold sweat, while Zhou Yunsheng respectfully replied, "Your Majesty, I do not need a quarter of an hour—just a few breaths will suffice."

With that, he picked up the book, flipped through it rapidly, then handed it to the chief eunuch before closing his eyes and reciting flawlessly.

The Emperor held the book, verifying his words. His expression shifted from cold to solemn, then from solemn to astonishment.

"Wait, start reciting from the third row on page 76." He ordered.

Zhou Yunsheng did not pause for even a moment and began reciting from the first word of the third row, without a single mistake.

"Recite from the sixth row on page 100."

Zhou Yunsheng continued without hesitation.

"Start from the third character of the seventh row on page 38."

Zhou Yunsheng nodded and followed the instruction exactly. His soul power was inherently strong, making "photographic memory" an understatement. Coupled with the super search engine 007, even if the Tianchen Emperor presented him with the most obscure books from the Great Zhou Dynasty, he could recite them fluently, forward and backward.

The Tianchen Emperor was utterly stunned, unable to speak for a long while. When he finally recovered, he worried that Zhou Yunsheng had memorized the book beforehand. To confirm his doubts, he ordered someone to fetch a newly compiled dictionary from the Hanlin Academy.

The dictionary had not yet been published; only the compilers and the Tianchen Emperor himself had seen it. It contained several million characters and was as thick as a brick.

"You have fifteen minutes. Recite this dictionary." This time, he did not throw the book but had his personal attendant hand it over. His tone was noticeably softer, showing that he was beginning to believe.

Shen's father remained kneeling, occasionally turning to look at his son, as if he no longer recognized him.

Zhou Yunsheng agreed without hesitation, flipping through the dictionary at the fastest speed. Under the emperor's examination, he recited it forwards, backwards, from the middle, and in fragments—displaying his photographic memory in every possible way.

The Tianchen Emperor was completely convinced. After a long silence, he finally spoke slowly, "Since you possess such extraordinary talent, why would you purchase the exam questions in advance? Was it not unnecessary trouble?"

Zhou Yunsheng showed a helpless expression. "Your Majesty, my humble servant's bookboy thought I would fail the exam and took it upon himself to buy the questions. I only learned of it afterward and thought, 'How could exam questions be purchased for just a few thousand taels of silver? Surely, it was a scam.' So I merely glanced at them before discarding them. Your humble servant was ignorant—please, Your Majesty, have mercy."

The Tianchen Emperor nodded thoughtfully. After a moment, he probed, "Your Two-Tax System is not flawless—are you aware of this?"

Zhou Yunsheng cupped his hands and replied, neither humble nor overbearing, "Your Majesty, I am aware. However, due to the length limitations of policy essays, I could not elaborate further in writing. The flaws of the Two-Tax System are as follows:

First, the long-term lack of adjustments to household classifications prevents the fair distribution of tax burdens based on wealth.

Second, the portion of the tax paid in currency exacerbates the shortage of circulating money, leading to inflation. People will be forced to sell silk, grain, and other goods at low prices to pay their taxes, increasing their financial burden.

Third, with legal land transactions, land annexation will become more rampant, and the wealthy…"

He listed the potential issues of the Two-Tax System one by one. Building on that, he proposed the more refined Single Whip Law and the Land Tax Reform. His vision was far-reaching, his reasoning meticulous, and his explanations exceptionally clear—so much so that the Tianchen Emperor was astounded and applauded in admiration.

"Someone, bring seats for Shen Gongzi and Shen Daren." The Tianchen Emperor personally stepped down from his throne to help them up, his face adorned with a warm smile. A true scholar always earned his respect—let alone a genius like Shen Yibin.

Zhou Yunsheng's backside was sore. As he sat down, he shook slightly, making the Tianchen Emperor feel even more guilty. The discussion then shifted from tax reform to land policies and military strategies. Zhou Yunsheng spoke concisely, his words sharp and thought-provoking. The Tianchen Emperor was utterly engrossed, wishing he could keep Zhou Yunsheng in the palace for a long, in-depth conversation.

Shen's father sat in a daze, holding his teacup, staring blankly at his son.

As the palace gates were about to close for the night, the Tianchen Emperor finally remembered that the father and son were still injured and hungry. He quickly summoned the imperial physician and had a meal prepared. After their wounds were treated and they had finished dining, the emperor personally escorted them to the palace gates and asked with a smile, "With such great talent, why has Yibin remained unknown until now?"

Zhou Yunsheng blushed slightly and cupped his hands. "Your Majesty, my father has high expectations for me. If he knew of my intelligence, he would confine me at home and not allow me to leave until I had read every book in Great Zhou. But I enjoy playing and cannot sit still, so I chose to hide my abilities."

Shen Yibin was only seventeen, and with the exceptional looks he inherited from his parents, his youthful face now bore a slight blush—making him look incredibly pure and endearing. Even the stray grain of rice stuck to his cheek did not diminish his charm in the slightest.

Emperor Tianchen carefully examined him for a moment, growing more and more fond of him. He personally picked off a grain of rice from his face and laughed heartily. "You call this hiding your talent? This is not just hiding some skill; this is hiding great skill."

Zhou Yunsheng looked embarrassed and quickly said, "Your Majesty, please don't laugh at me."

The father and son boarded the carriage and left the palace gates. Only then did Shen Father finally come to his senses. He raised his fist and gave his son a good beating. "I told you to hide your talent, I told you to hide your talent! If it weren’t for the fact that buying the real exam questions meant certain death, were you planning to hide it for a lifetime?"

Zhou Yunsheng dodged while joking, "Indeed, no one knows a son better than his father. I just don’t want to be an official. It’s too exhausting—having to attend court before dawn every day."

After finishing his beating, Shen Father let out a satisfied breath and laughed. "Even if you don’t want to, you have to! Do you think the Emperor will let you go? I thought our Shen family had reached a dead end, but who knew I’d have such a brilliant son? My dear son, did it hurt?"

Zhou Yunsheng shuddered at his father’s overly affectionate tone.



====================================================================================



Chapter 3.3
Not only did the Shen father and son return home safe and sound, but Shen Yibin also received an imperial decree from the Emperor. He was ordered to participate in the palace examination once the case was thoroughly investigated. If he failed to take the top scholar position, he should never consider entering officialdom again.

This showed just how high Emperor Tianchen’s expectations were for Shen Yibin. As long as he truly secured the top rank, his future rise to power and prominence would be inevitable.

Madam Shen circled around her son several times, beaming with joy. "I always knew my son was the smartest in the world. He’s been brilliant since childhood!"

Shen Father recalled his son's intelligence as a child and couldn’t help but sigh. He had once feared his son was a wasted talent like the prodigy Fang Zhongyong, but who would have thought the boy had been deliberately hiding his abilities all along? Every time he thought about it, he felt both exasperated and amused.

"Yibin, after some thought, I believe you’re right. The Seventh Prince is unrighteous, and your sister is unloved. It is time for us to change allegiance and serve a new master," Shen Father sighed as he stroked his beard.

"But if we stop supporting the Seventh Prince, wouldn’t Qiaodan suffer even more in the inner court?" Madam Shen’s eyes turned red with worry.

"Mother, you’ve misunderstood. As long as the Shen family remains strong, the Seventh Prince wouldn’t dare mistreat Sister. I’ve heard that he now favors his concubine, Lady Xie, above all others, treating the rest of his women as if they were invisible. If we continue supporting the Seventh Prince, the biggest beneficiary won’t be Sister—it will be Lady Xie, who enjoys his favor. Why should we toil for someone else's gain?" Zhou Yunsheng reassured his mother, gently patting her hand.

Madam Shen thought for a moment and found his words reasonable. Remembering how the Seventh Prince had refused to help, instead punishing and confining their daughter, she realized he had indeed been cruel to the Shen family. She said no more.

Due to the eunuch’s crime of stealing the examination questions, Emperor Tianchen carried out a major purge within the inner palace, eliminating spies planted by various factions. As a result, the Seventh Prince remained unaware that the extraordinary policy essay circulating among scholars had actually been penned by the so-called ignorant Shen Yibin.

Xie Yurou had been reborn and had deliberately befriended talented individuals who had been favored by the Seventh Prince in her past life. Among them was Lin Wenjie, a scholar renowned for ghostwriting essays for examination candidates.

Upon hearing that the Emperor possessed an exceptionally brilliant essay and was searching for its author, she subtly hinted to the Seventh Prince, claiming to have coincidentally met an extraordinary talent and suggesting he look into it.

Wanting to impress his father and recruit capable individuals, the Seventh Prince personally visited Lin Wenjie’s residence.

Lin Wenjie, a concubine-born son, had suffered under his stepmother’s oppression. He had initially planned to participate in the imperial examination, but his stepmother refused to find him a sponsor and even ordered servants to burn his academic documents, preventing him from entering the examination hall.

Living in hardship, he had been forced to write essays and poetry for money, gradually earning widespread fame. As the examination approached, more and more people came to him seeking essays, all focused on the same topic—the Land Tax System (租庸调). They repeatedly warned him not to publicize his work and never to write the same piece again in public. The payments ranged from thousands to tens of thousands of taels.

Being exceptionally intelligent, Lin Wenjie quickly realized the implications. He spent several days refining an outstanding essay and then sold it to multiple candidates. He did this deliberately, hoping to stir up a commotion and draw the Emperor’s attention to himself.

Thus, when the Seventh Prince arrived, Lin Wenjie was already dressed in his finest robes, prepared to welcome him with utmost respect.

The two discussed various academic topics, and the Seventh Prince, impressed by Lin Wenjie’s knowledge, explained his purpose for visiting. Lin Wenjie’s essay had already spread among the examiners and the court, but Zhou Yunsheng’s masterpiece had been carefully safeguarded by Emperor Tianchen. The Emperor had even instructed the examiners to keep it confidential to prevent any malicious schemes.

As a result, the Seventh Prince only knew about Lin Wenjie’s essay but was unaware that a far superior one existed.

After comparing their writings, Lin Wenjie feigned alarm and said, "So the essay on the Land Tax System was used in this context? This humble scholar was ignorant and deserves punishment!"

The Seventh Prince quickly helped him up, assuring him that the Emperor bore no grudge and was actually searching for the author to serve the court. Lin Wenjie was secretly overjoyed but pretended to decline a few times before agreeing to enter the palace with the prince.

Inside the Diligence Hall (勤政殿), Emperor Tianchen remained silent, scrutinizing Lin Wenjie with an inscrutable gaze. Only when Lin Wenjie began sweating profusely did the Emperor finally speak.

"Since you claim to have written that essay, can you recite it for me?"

Lin Wenjie steadied himself, bowed, and began reciting.

The Emperor’s stern expression turned to one of disdain, followed by a hint of disappointment. If not for Zhou Yunsheng’s work, the Emperor would have considered Lin Wenjie’s essay the best and would have been eager to recruit him. However, this man had rushed into the palace the moment he heard of an extraordinary essay in the examination, clearly revealing his opportunistic nature. Compared to the carefree, effortlessly brilliant Shen Yibin, he was utterly unremarkable.

"Enough. This essay is good but not remarkable enough to impress me," Emperor Tianchen stated coldly. "You are talented, but you are too eager for quick success."

He picked up the essay he had read countless times and handed it to his trusted attendant.

"Learning is meant for application; reading should begin with humility. Let him read this, so he knows why he lost."

Lin Wenjie sensed something was wrong. Trembling, he took the essay and read it carefully. Moments later, his face turned deathly pale.

"You should read it too, Old Seventh," the Emperor said with a wave of his sleeve.

The Seventh Prince complied and, after reading, was utterly shocked.

"Such an exquisite essay, filled with brilliant rhetoric and profound insights—may I ask, Father, which great scholar authored this masterpiece?" The Seventh Prince knelt respectfully.

"None other than your dear brother-in-law," Emperor Tianchen laughed heartily. "To buy himself more leisure time, he feigned ignorance before Shen Daren for over a decade. If he hadn't been pushed into a desperate situation, who knows how much longer he would have hidden his talents?"

The Seventh Prince’s heart pounded violently. He raised his head in astonishment, staring at the Emperor.

Emperor Tianchen could not be bothered to explain further and simply waved his hand. "I am weary. Leave now. When refining your literary skills, do not forget to cultivate your character. Always remember—there is always someone better than you."

Lin Wenjie was overwhelmed with shame. He bowed repeatedly before retreating with his face covered. The Seventh Prince had him escorted home but lost all interest in associating with him.

Sitting in his carriage, he carefully reflected on the essay.

Such a masterpiece, more splendid than the finest literary works of past dynasties, had actually come from Shen Yibin’s hand. He never would have believed it—if not for his father’s infallible judgment.

Realizing he had intended to ease his father’s burdens only to end up making a fool of himself, realizing the Emperor’s high regard for Shen Yibin, realizing how he had neglected Shen Qiaodan and abandoned the Shen family…

The Seventh Prince’s face flushed crimson, as if he had been slapped dozens of times. His cheeks burned with shame.

Shen Yibin was highly favored, and Shen Hui was one of the top officials in the Great Zhou. Losing the support of the Shen father and son was like losing his left and right arms. The Seventh Prince regretted it deeply and began to resent Xie Yuruo, who had misled him. After returning, he gave her a stern reprimanding.

He thought he had ruined Shen Hui's career, but unexpectedly, someone even more capable than Shen Hui, Shen Yibin, had emerged. Xie Yuruo carefully recalled Shen Yibin’s previous life and found that he had been a playboy with no visible talents at all.

Shen Yibin had always been fond of enjoying life. In his past life, with Shen Hui supporting him, he naturally lived a carefree life. But in this life, pushed to a dead-end, his true abilities were finally revealed. Did his own decisions cause this sudden change? Would there be even more unforeseen consequences in the future? Without the Shen family’s support, could the Seventh Prince still successfully ascend the throne?

Thinking about this, Xie Yuruo felt uneasy, secretly cursing her rash actions. She had effectively shot herself in the foot. However, she then remembered that she had already prepared a backup plan with the Crown Prince. No matter how much support the Seventh Prince had from officials, he would eventually bring about his own downfall. With that, she regained her composure.

The corruption case was finally resolved, and a large number of officials under the Crown Prince were dismissed. The Crown Prince himself was severely reprimanded by the Tianchen Emperor in front of all the court officials, losing all his face.

After a brief period of rest, the Tianchen Emperor issued an imperial decree to reopen the palace exam.

Zhou Yunsheng easily won the top scholar position and smoothly entered the palace exam. This time, the exam topic was still quite simple—only four characters: "Scholars, Farmers, Artisans, Merchants." The topic was vast, abstract in concept, and difficult to address, making many students frown and hesitate before they dared to write.

Zhou Yunsheng closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, his writing flowed like water, completing the essay in one stroke. "Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are the foundation of the nation... Thus, a person does not hold office for others, and an official does not take over another's work. Scholars and farmers speak of strength, officials speak of conduct, artisans speak of skill, and merchants speak of numbers..."

He rejected the contemporary notion that "scholars are noble, and merchants are lowly" and fully elaborated on the contributions each group made to societal progress, especially the significant role of business development for the nation. His words were sharp and profound.

During the palace exam, most candidates wrote in a steady and cautious manner, aiming for harmony without offending the emperor. But Zhou Yunsheng, through his analysis, understood that the Tianchen Emperor’s tax reforms were actually aimed at lifting the sea ban to prepare for external trade. This essay not only didn’t touch a nerve, it struck the emperor’s interests.

Indeed, when the Tianchen Emperor approached him, he only glanced at two lines before pausing, and when he finished reading the entire essay, he couldn't help but clap and cheer.

All the scholars raised their heads, already knowing who the top scholar of the exam was.

As soon as the palace exam ended, the Tianchen Emperor eagerly summoned Zhou Yunsheng for a debate, and they continued discussing until it was dark before reluctantly letting him leave.

Three days later, the imperial decree came down, appointing Shen Yibin as the top scholar of the exam and granting him the position of an Assistant Scholar in the Hanlin Academy. He started his official career as a fifth-rank official, a close minister to the emperor, at only eighteen years old. If he trained well over the next few years, he would likely enter the cabinet and become a prime minister.

Now, Shen Yibin had become the most sought-after person in the capital. The suitors almost broke down the door of the Shen family.

Zhou Yunsheng used the excuse of "establishing a career before marriage" to reject all proposals. Shen’s father and mother, now eager to dote on him, naturally agreed with whatever he said.

Seventh Prince's Residence.

The Seventh Prince was reviewing the gift list that Shen Qiaodan had handed over and felt it was not enough, so he added another thirty percent. He said gently, "Once Yibin enters the Hanlin Academy, he will inevitably have to interact with others. As his elder sister, you should prepare more social gifts for him."

"Of course, I understand. I will go check the storeroom again." Shen Qiaodan replied with a smile, but her eyes no longer held any affection for the Seventh Prince. She had already realized that she had been given a sterilization drug, and she had long given up on vying for favor. As long as her family was powerful, her position in the household was unshakable. Instead of currying favor with the Seventh Prince, it was better to strengthen her relationship with her brother, who was her lifelong support.

As Shen Qiaodan came out of the main hall, she encountered the haggard-looking Xie Yuruo and couldn't help but sneer. "No matter how favored you are, so what? As long as the Shen family stands strong, you will never surpass me! All the schemes you’ve made in the past will one day be paid back to you!"


==================================


Chapter 3.4

The crown prince's failure to properly oversee his subordinates and his lax supervision led to this corruption scandal. Once the news spread, his reputation among the civil officials and scholars plummeted. The position of crown prince, which had already been shaky, became even more precarious.

Fortunately, Emperor Tianchen had not yet lost complete faith in the crown prince. After a few days of self-reflection, he entrusted him with overseeing the Qionglin Banquet, hoping to help him restore some of his tarnished reputation.

However, the crown prince was ungrateful. As soon as Emperor Tianchen left, he put on a scowl, poured wine for himself from the wine jug, and ignored everyone around him. He had lost a large number of subordinates during the imperial examination, and had been publicly scolded by his father in front of the court officials, losing all face. How could he possibly have a good impression of the scholars at the banquet?

Zhou Yunsheng, seated at the lower end of the hall, secretly observed the crown prince, who was infamous for his indulgence and reckless behavior. He was extremely handsome, with long, sharp eyebrows slanting into his temples, and narrow phoenix eyes gleaming with sharpness. When he looked at people, it always seemed as if he was looking down on them, making them instinctively fearful.

He was dressed in a dark robe, the collar wide open, revealing a white undergarment underneath. The thin fabric clung to his muscular frame, and even from a distance, one could sense the strength concealed within his seemingly frail body. He sat in a relaxed manner, with one leg crossed over the other, holding a wine jug in one hand and a wine cup in the other. His eyes were a bit hazy from drinking, but he did not appear disheveled. Instead, he seemed even sharper and wilder.

He seemed a bit bored, setting down his wine cup and propping his chin up with one hand, giving the scholars a half-smiling, half-amused glance. His cold gaze made everyone uneasy, and they quickly lowered their heads and avoided his eyes.

It was well known that the crown prince’s temper was erratic, and one could never tell what might trigger his wrath. He had dared to play with Emperor Tianchen's consorts, embezzle tax money from the national treasury, and even drew a sword in the imperial court to seriously injure an official who had angered him. His style could be summed up in one word: reckless! Or rather, reckless to the extreme!

In his presence, others not only dared not make noise, but were even afraid to breathe too loudly.

At this moment, the hall was filled only with the soft sound of silk and bamboo instruments, with no other noise.

Zhou Yunsheng withdrew his gaze and silently marveled at the crown prince's appearance. His looks were so striking that even the world’s male lead, the Seventh Prince, could not compare.

At the same time, the crown prince was also eyeing this year's top scholar. It was well known that the crown prince was fond of beautiful people, and anyone who caught his eye, regardless of gender, would be taken by him. The scholar, Shen Yibin, was indeed a stunning beauty, comparable to a dragon and phoenix, with a complexion like spring flowers. His peach blossom eyes shone with a captivating light, and after drinking, his eyes became slightly moist, making him appear like a cute little animal.

Moreover, he was the youngest among the scholars, dressed in a bright red top scholar’s robe, sitting among the elderly scholars with their long beards. He stood out like a firefly in the night, dazzling and impossible to ignore.

The crown prince's eyes darkened as he tapped the wine jug with his fingers, clearly intrigued.

His personal attendant noticed the crown prince’s reaction and whispered, “Your Highness, would you like to call the top scholar over for a drink?”

“No,” the crown prince waved his hand and pointed in another direction. “Call over the third place scholar.” He knew that Shen Yibin had the Emperor’s favor, so he would not make a move on the top scholar during the Qionglin Banquet.

The third place scholar was twenty-five years old, though not as exceptionally handsome as Shen Yibin, he was still a dashing and refined young man. When the crown prince pointed to him, his face immediately turned pale.

“Third place scholar, His Highness the Crown Prince requests your presence,” an attendant called out, his voice eerily cold, like a ghost calling for someone’s soul.

The third place scholar wanted to refuse, but after meeting the crown prince’s unpredictable gaze, his legs went weak. Not only could he not speak, he couldn’t even stand properly and accidentally spilled an entire jug of wine on himself.

Everyone quietly glanced over, offering him their full sympathy.

“May I ask, esteemed eunuch, if I have the honor of sharing a drink with His Highness the Crown Prince?” At that moment, Zhou Yunsheng smiled and cupped his hands.

The attendant quickly glanced at him and bowed, “The top scholar is most thoughtful. Please, do.”

The third place scholar, relieved to see the young man heading up to the high seat, sighed deeply and silently appreciated the favor. Others were also impressed by the top scholar’s selflessness. It was said that serving a monarch was like serving a tiger, but this crown prince was much fiercer than any tiger.

It was clear that the crown prince did not expect Zhou Yunsheng to take the initiative. He waved his sleeve, signaling for him to sit, and then fixed his gaze on him. He found that the young man did not appear forced or fearful, and his gloomy mood inexplicably lifted.

“You’re quite perceptive, doing me a favor,” he said, a forced smile on his face.

Zhou Yunsheng cupped his hands, his tone light and cheerful. “It’s not really a favor. I will be serving as a scholar at the Hanlin Academy starting tomorrow, and I’ll be reading books to the crown prince every day. Naturally, I should get closer to His Highness, so I don’t mess up the job.”

He not only had a pure and innocent appearance, but his voice was also clear and bright, making anyone who heard it feel at ease. The crown prince scoffed, but his expression softened, and he muttered, “The fearless young.”

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his head and touched his nose, his gaze drifting to the crown prince’s wooden sandals. It was still early spring, and the night was chilly enough that people needed to wear thick cotton robes to stay warm. Yet the crown prince was dressed very thinly, wearing only wooden sandals. Was he not afraid of the cold?

The thought crossed his mind and quickly passed, as the crown prince personally handed him a cup of wine. He took it quickly, savoring the taste. It was royal wine, served in a Western Phoenix vase, and had been warmed with hot water. The aftertaste was delightful.

The crown prince noticed the way he licked his lips, and a mischievous gleam appeared in his eyes. He found it quite endearing and encouraged him to drink several more cups. The two of them exchanged cups and joked, appearing as if they had known each other for many years, even though it was their first meeting.

The Seventh Prince, who had been sitting nearby, was waiting for the crown prince to make a move so that he could step in to save Shen Yibin, hoping to do the Shen family a favor. Seeing the situation unfold, he became disheartened.

The crown prince loved wine, and after finishing the Western Phoenix vase, he ordered two jars of Crane Year tribute wine to be placed in hot water, waiting to be served.

“Drinking on an empty stomach hurts the stomach. Eat something first.” Seeing the young man’s flushed face and his eyes becoming dazed, the crown prince chuckled, reaching out to touch his temple.

“Yes, Your Highness.” Shen Yibin’s body was still young and had not yet reached the point where he could drink endlessly. Zhou Yunsheng, by contrast, was beginning to feel a bit dizzy. Although 007 could adjust the host’s physical condition, he couldn’t use it in front of so many people. Besides, it would be too suspicious if he suddenly recovered from drunkenness. The crown prince was still watching him.

He hurriedly took a few bites of food, then looked up at the crown prince, complaining, “The food is cold and tastes terrible!”

“It’s because it’s cold that it’s good.” The crown prince smiled mysteriously, eating with relish. He finished two bowls before stopping and continued drinking, pouring large amounts into the small top scholar’s cup.

Zhou Yunsheng was becoming overwhelmed, his mind clouded with alcohol. The food felt stuck in his throat, ready to be regurgitated. Seeing the crown prince pour more wine for him, he waved him off and stumbled out of the room.

Everyone thought the top scholar had finally had enough and fled, their faces showing concern.

The crown prince thought the same, and his face darkened immediately. He placed his hand on the sword at his waist, and a bloodthirsty aura began to emanate from his eyes. He had thought he had finally made a friend who shared his temperament, but it seemed that he was just another ungrateful person. In that case, he might as well kill him to rid himself of the nuisance.

The Seventh Prince was about to step forward to plead for him but saw the crown prince’s murderous intent and sat back down. He reasoned that the Shen family had already distanced themselves from him, and saving Shen Yibin wouldn’t earn him their gratitude. It might be better to let the crown prince kill him, creating a rift between the crown prince and the Shen family, and making Emperor Tianchen lose faith in the crown prince. It would be a win in many ways.

The other princes shared his thoughts, and for a moment, no one stepped forward to stop the crown prince.

The third place scholar struggled for a moment, about to speak, but then saw the chief eunuch return, whispering in the crown prince’s ear.

The crown prince raised his eyebrows, and his expression cleared instantly. Without saying a word, he waved his sleeve and left.

Everyone was stunned, realizing just how unpredictable the crown prince’s moods could be.

In the imperial garden, Zhou Yunsheng was bent over the lotus pond, vomiting. Just as he was adjusting his body to the state of never being drunk, the crown prince appeared, looking at him with a mocking gaze. “It’s just a few jars of wine, and you’re drunk like this? Truly useless.”

“I’m only seventeen.” Zhou Yunsheng complained, his peach blossom eyes glistening with tears. When the main god brought him here, he was only sixteen and not even of legal drinking age. Although he had lived through countless reincarnations, he firmly believed he would always be sixteen.

The crown prince found it even more amusing, muttering, “Little brat.”

Zhou Yunsheng ignored him and continued vomiting, watching the fish come to the surface of the water to devour the vomit. His stomach emptied again.

Seeing the fish rise to the surface of the water one by one to devour his vomit, Zhou Yunsheng’s already empty stomach heaved up more bile. He incredulously said, "They... they actually eat the leftovers I’ve thrown up, this is so disgusting! I never expected the fish in the imperial garden to be so gross."

The crown prince couldn't hold back anymore and broke into a hearty laugh. After finishing, he took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the boy's mouth, his actions very tender. He liked the way the boy treated him with such intimacy and calm, which made him unconsciously lower his guard and forget his worries.

Zhou Yunsheng thanked him and, supporting himself with his hand, stood up. His heart skipped a beat. The crown prince’s hand was very hot, almost as if it were burning up. This was obviously not the normal body temperature of a human. He couldn't help but lean in closer and faintly smelled a medicinal scent. Due to his extraordinary senses, he identified substances like stalactites, amethyst, quartz, brimstone, red resin, lapis lazuli, and even poppy, among other medicinal herbs.

The crown prince had been raised by Emperor Tianchen, receiving his father's direct teachings. He had shown exceptional political talent from a young age. However, three years ago, his temperament changed drastically. Not only did he indulge in luxury and pleasure, but his actions became increasingly reckless and audacious. Emperor Tianchen had called him to the palace many times to admonish him, but no matter what, he could not be corrected.

Zhou Yunsheng felt that he might have found the root cause of the crown prince’s drastic change in temperament.

======================================


Chapter 3.5

That night, Zhou Yunsheng returned home and recounted everything to his father, Shen, about his drunken behavior and the events that transpired.

"I never thought you would catch the Crown Prince’s eye. That's quite rare," Shen said, stroking his beard. "The Crown Prince has been ill-tempered in recent years and hardly ever shows such a pleasant demeanor." However, there was concern in his heart. This prince had been acting recklessly, and his relationship with the Emperor had grown strained. Recently, there had been repeated petitions from court officials requesting to depose the Crown Prince. It was not a good thing that his son had gotten so close to him.

Zhou Yunsheng understood what his father was worried about and continued, "I behaved poorly and angered the Crown Prince, yet the Seventh Prince didn't say a word during the whole affair, as though he was enjoying the spectacle. Father, the Seventh Prince is no wise ruler."

Shen’s eyes darkened, and he fell silent.

Zhou Yunsheng returned to his room, sent his personal maid away, and sat by the lamp, lost in thought. He had experienced many lifetimes, and in one of them, he had been the leader of a demonic sect, possessing exceptional martial arts skills and unparalleled medical and poison expertise. The Crown Prince's strong medicinal scent indicated that he frequently took a particular prescription, though it was a fatal one.

The medicine was called Cold Food Powder, or more commonly known as Five Stone Powder. It induced a state of euphoria, making one feel as though they were floating and forgetting themselves.

However, its main use was to treat febrile diseases. It was a life-saving remedy that could quickly restore the body to health if used correctly. But if misused, it could lead to addiction and poison the body.

After taking this powder, the body would experience high fever, and if the heat was not released in time, it would be fatal. To release the heat, the person had to eat cold rice, wear thin clothing, sleep on a cold mat, and take cold baths—anything that prevented the body from coming into contact with heat. But the Crown Prince, of course, indulged in drinking alcohol, especially warm and good wine, to help release the heat more effectively in a state of slight drunkenness.

Over time, this would cause many aftereffects, one of which was a violent temper. It also led to an excessively high body temperature and fragile skin that could easily tear. Therefore, he had to wear soft, worn-out clothes and avoid new garments, opting for loose and flowing attire. To reduce foot irritation, he even had to forgo boots and wear wooden clogs instead.

From all this, it became clear that the Crown Prince’s reckless behavior and wild demeanor were not entirely of his own choosing but rather a result of his condition.

Thinking of this, Zhou Yunsheng opened his device and searched for information about the Cold Food Powder in the Great Zhou Dynasty. After a moment, he exhaled deeply. There was no record of this powder in the dynasty's history, which meant it was a secret medicine, likely known only to the Crown Prince.

He could almost guess the intentions of the person who supplied the medicine.

The Crown Prince, aged 27, was in the prime of his life, while Emperor Tianchen, at 65, was considered quite old. It was clear that he would soon pass away. The Emperor had always favored the Crown Prince, who excelled in politics, even surpassing his father in governance, and was beloved by the officials and the people in his early years.

But such an outstanding heir—who could not be dissatisfied? As long as the Crown Prince continued to act prudently, no one could challenge him. Some, unable to shake his position externally, had resorted to undermining him internally.

This method was ingenious, eliminating the most powerful opponent without any need for armies.

Thinking of the female lead who possessed a space for medicine and a spiritual spring, Zhou Yunsheng suspected that the Cold Food Powder was most likely the work of her and the Seventh Prince. They wanted to destroy the Crown Prince, but Zhou Yunsheng was determined to stand against them and help the Crown Prince ascend the throne.

With that thought in mind, Zhou Yunsheng blew out the candle and fell asleep peacefully.

The Crown Prince found the young scholar to be very interesting. Not only was he handsome, but he was also very bold. He radiated an energy that made the Crown Prince feel at ease whenever he was around.

"Your Highness, do you have any further questions?" Zhou Yunsheng asked, holding a copy of the Book of Changes and bowing slightly.

Although the Crown Prince appeared to be listening to him explain the book, his gaze was actually focused on the young scholar’s beautifully shaped lips, which moved as he spoke. When their eyes met, the Crown Prince snapped out of his daze and waved his hand. "No, sit down. Stay and practice calligraphy with me."

After a month of interaction, the two had become quite familiar with each other. Zhou Yunsheng sat down and, without being asked, ground ink for the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince had once written with a bold and flowing regular script, but three years ago, he had suddenly switched to cursive writing, even the most difficult and wild kind.

His natural talent was extraordinary. In just a few months, he mastered this difficult style to perfection.

Zhou Yunsheng looked down and saw that the Crown Prince’s brushwork was powerful and deep, as a poem quickly appeared on the paper:

"How great is my decay!"

"Sorrow for my life, friendships scattered, how many remain?"

"White hair hanging in a long stream, a smile makes all things in the world fade."

"What can bring joy to you, my lord?"

"I see the green mountains, so enchanting, and imagine they, too, see me as such."

"My feelings and appearance, slightly alike."

"A lone figure scratching his head under the east window."

"Thinking of Yuanming, pausing to read poetry, the flavor is just right."

"In the eastern Jiang region, those seeking fame are unaware of the profound meaning of turbid wine!"

Zhou Yunsheng slowly mulled over these words and then noticed that a streak of white hair had appeared at the Crown Prince’s temple. He couldn’t help but feel a pang of sorrow. Someone capable of writing such magnificent poetry and exquisite calligraphy shouldn’t end up in such a state, neither man nor ghost.

Seeing the Crown Prince put down his brush and take a deep drink from the wine jug, Zhou Yunsheng finally voiced what had been on his mind for some time. "Your Highness, you cannot continue like this."

The Crown Prince didn’t get angry, only giving him a half-smile.

Zhou Yunsheng continued, "Please forgive my audacity, but I would like to see your medicine for myself."

"What, do you want to try a dose?" The Crown Prince put down his wine jug and raised an eyebrow. If anyone else coveted his secret medicine, he would have had them turned into minced meat by now. But with this young scholar, he felt no anger whatsoever.

"No, if I wanted to take it, I would have already made it myself. I wouldn’t wait until now."

"You can make it? How would you make it? This prescription is known only to me."

The Crown Prince, in terms of both appearance and ability, far surpassed ordinary people, yet he had one flaw: his frail health. It was an ailment from birth, incurable. Every winter, he would cough incessantly and suffer greatly. Fortunately, during one of his hunting trips, he saved an old Taoist priest, who, in return, presented him with this remedy. The old man claimed that if taken for five years, it could cure all ailments and prolong life.

The Crown Prince took care of the Taoist for several months, but the man eventually died from his injuries. The Crown Prince had verified the authenticity of the medicine, and the results were significant.

He knew that without a healthy body, even sitting on the highest throne would be unbearable. He had tested the medicine on several others and watched their weak bodies grow stronger day by day. Naturally, he was moved. By now, he had been taking it for three years and could not escape its control.

Although Cold Food Powder was toxic, it was indeed a miraculous medicine for treating diseases. The strong effects of the medicine triggered internal heat, and once the heat was expelled, it removed years of hidden toxins, quickly restoring the body to health. To expel the medicine’s effects, cold food, clothing, baths, and sleep were required, along with plenty of exercise, which also helped to strengthen the body.

Three years ago, the Crown Prince had been frail, but now he was muscular. If one looked closely through the open collar, they could see the change. That’s why he was so confident in the medicine’s efficacy.

Zhou Yunsheng quickly organized his thoughts, cupped his hands, and said, “Your Highness, my sense of smell is far beyond ordinary people. I can distinguish the true essence of various scents with just a hint of fragrance. I am also well-versed in the art of medicine and poison. Your Highness has been taking medicine for many years, and the strong scent of medicine on you is noticeable. With just a sniff, I can tell exactly what ingredients are in the formula and how much of each is required.”

The Prince became interested, a smile curving his lips as he said, “Then tell me, if you get even one ingredient wrong, I’ll punish you.” As he spoke, he reached out to gently caress the young man’s slender neck, his touch both dangerous and ambiguous.

Zhou Yunsheng nodded, listing the ingredients one by one, “Three taels of stalactite, two taels of amethyst, half a tael of white amethyst, three taels of sulfur, red stone resin…”

As he spoke, the Prince’s expression grew more complex, shifting from one extreme to another.

Zhou Yunsheng was not afraid. After finishing the list, he straightforwardly said, “Your Highness, the medicine is indeed good, but if used for an extended period, it may endanger your life. Your temper has been growing increasingly erratic in recent years, and this medicine is the root cause.”

The Prince placed his right hand on his sword, his gaze flashing with cold, concealed killing intent.

Zhou Yunsheng did not wait for him to make a move and continued, “Your Highness is noble, and before taking the medicine, you must have had it tested. However, this method only shows short-term effects, not long-term ones. I have a better method. Your Highness can try it and then decide whether to punish me for my presumptuous words. I know that what I am saying today is highly inappropriate, and speaking too much might cost me my life. However, I cannot bear to see the Prince suffer without knowing, so I risk my life to offer my advice. Please give me a chance to prove myself.”

The Prince gripped his chin, his sharp gaze locking onto his eyes. He saw the deep concern and care within them, and his heart trembled.

“Fine, I’ll give you a chance.” After a long pause, he released the young man, his thin lips curving into a cold, sharp smile.

Zhou Yunsheng’s jaw was left bruised from being gripped so tightly. After stepping back two paces, he rubbed it, his eyes glistening with tears.

Seeing his pitiful and adorable appearance, all the Prince’s anger seemed to dissipate in an instant.

The next day, the top scholar brought two white mice into the palace to present them to the Prince as a gift for his amusement. The Prince carefully nurtured them for several days, seemingly very fond of them.

That afternoon, after court, a eunuch rushed over, flustered, and said, “Your Highness, something has happened to the two white mice.”

The Prince’s heart skipped a beat, and he hurried into the room.

The sight that greeted him was shocking. The two white mice had gone mad, squeaking loudly as they tried to bite the golden cage. Their front teeth had broken off, but they kept at it, scratching with their paws. Soon, they became entangled in a violent fight. Fifteen minutes later, all that was left in the cage were two pools of foul-smelling blood and flesh, and the once lively, cute mice were nowhere to be seen.

The Prince stared at the golden cage, his face turning from white to green, and then to purple, clearly furious beyond measure.

“Good old Taoist, good medicine, good repayment!” he seethed. “But who is behind all this? Second? Third? Fourth? Or perhaps they’ve all joined forces to put an end to me?”

The Prince slowly walked to the table, drank a pot of warm strong liquor, and finally, unable to suppress it any longer, let out a low laugh. No matter who it was, he would rather kill the wrong person than let one escape!


 ===========================================================


Chapter 3.6

When Zhou Yunsheng was summoned to the East Palace, the Crown Prince was standing in front of a large mirror, his inscrutable gaze examining his own body.

He had removed his brocade robe and undergarments, wearing only a thin pair of underpants. His back and chest muscles were strong and well-defined, with smooth, graceful lines. Two mermaid lines led down to his waist, highlighting the neatly arranged, firm abs. His bronze skin glowed under the sunlight, radiating a fluorescent sheen. It was a body full of power and allure, one that could captivate anyone with just a glance.

The two palace maids holding the Crown Prince’s robe were already blushing with embarrassment, but they couldn’t help but steal a glance at him.

Zhou Yunsheng was momentarily stunned, then immediately bowed respectfully, not daring to look further. He had a preference for strong and handsome men, and the Crown Prince was exactly the type he admired.

“You’re here,” the Crown Prince dismissed the servants in the room, stroking his abs as he slowly spoke, “Do you think this physique is perfect and flawless?”

Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him quickly and nodded in agreement.

The Crown Prince chuckled coldly, “What a pity, the outside is perfect, but the inside has long been corrupted.” As he spoke, the rage, hatred, despair, and madness hidden in his eyes were released, and the negative emotions piled up in the air, making it hard to breathe.

Zhou Yunsheng closed his eyes briefly and said in a soft voice, “If Your Highness can stop taking Han Shisan and properly regulate your body for a few years, there may still be a chance of recovery.”

“Only a chance?” The Crown Prince put on his outer robe and slowly walked over, the height difference of ten centimeters and his innate powerful presence made Zhou Yunsheng feel slightly uncomfortable.

“If you don’t quit, it’s the same as drinking poison to quench thirst. If you continue for five more years, Your Highness will undoubtedly die.” Zhou Yunsheng had to step back two paces, moving out of the range of his overwhelming presence.

The Crown Prince was silent for a long time, finally waving his hand and saying, “Then let it be.”

Zhou Yunsheng bowed deeply and respectfully requested, “In that case, may Your Highness issue a decree stating that during the detoxification period, no matter how disrespectful I am, I shall not be punished.”

The Crown Prince didn’t respond, but instead fixed him with a profound, inscrutable gaze.

Zhou Yunsheng added, “If Your Highness suffers any mishap, I will accompany you to the netherworld.” As he spoke, he raised his head and looked at him with clear, watery eyes.

The Crown Prince seemed moved by his words, and a trace of warmth appeared on his frost-covered face. After a moment, he nodded, “Bring me pen, ink, paper, and brush.”

Half a year passed in the blink of an eye. On this day, Zhou Yunsheng untied the silken ribbons binding the Crown Prince’s limbs, exhaling a deep breath.

“How do you feel, Your Highness?” He carefully applied the ointment to the Prince’s swollen and ulcerated wrists.

The Crown Prince placed his hand on Zhou Yunsheng’s knee, staring at his gentle movements, his expression unreadable. How did he feel? From being strong to becoming weak again, naturally, it was extremely uncomfortable, not to mention the excruciating pain he had endured for the past six months. But compared to the heavy body, his mind was clearer than ever before. Reviewing everything from the past, it felt as though he had just awoken from a long dream, returning to the real world.

“How many years do I have left to live?” He knew that even if he stopped taking the medicine, his lifespan would still be affected.

“I don’t know, Your Highness. But as long as you maintain proper care, it should be fine.”

“Proper care? With my position, how can I have the peace of mind to care for myself?” The Crown Prince smiled softly, his eyes full of sarcasm.

Zhou Yunsheng said nothing, bowing deeply before preparing to leave. The Crown Prince, now mentally clear, was much more difficult to deal with than before. In the past, his emotions were unpredictable, but at least there was a glimpse of them. Now, however, he had become as deep and still as the sea, showing no hint of what was happening inside, no matter how tumultuous his heart was.

Just like a perfectly forged sword, its edge concealed, it could kill without warning. In the past six months, he had feigned illness and secluded himself in the East Palace. Not only did he regain the favor of Emperor Tianchen, but he also set up a trap that made the second, third, and fourth princes make continuous mistakes, reducing their reputation in the court. Other princes were also affected and had become much more obedient.

He seemed to have returned to the former wise and powerful Crown Prince, but only Zhou Yunsheng knew that his heart had changed. All his compassion had turned to dust, scattered in the wind, leaving only hatred.

The Crown Prince saw the growing distance between them and his expression darkened. He didn’t ask Zhou Yunsheng to rise, instead slowly speaking, “You and your father chose to serve me, but you didn’t expect me to be half-dead. Perhaps I can’t protect the glory of the Shen family for a hundred years.”

“Your Highness is the legitimate ruler of the Great Zhou. It is only right for us to serve you.” Zhou Yunsheng lowered his head and cupped his hands. Now, even he could no longer guess the Crown Prince’s thoughts, so he decided to speak less to avoid being killed before his mission was complete. His soul might not die, but Shen Yibin’s body certainly would.

The Crown Prince didn’t know what answer he was seeking from Zhou Yunsheng. Did he want him to express great loyalty? Or swear that his help was not for personal gain, but entirely from the heart? Would he stay loyal no matter what his own position was?

Why should he? And why did he need Zhou Yunsheng’s wholehearted devotion?

The Crown Prince couldn’t make sense of it. After staring at him for a while, he waved his hand, dismissing him.

“From now on, you can call me ‘Sinián.’”

As Zhou Yunsheng was about to step out the door, he suddenly heard a deep, hoarse voice behind him.

“Sinián? These two characters are my name. Do you have one?” The Crown Prince tilted his chin.

“Yunsheng, my name is Yunsheng.” Zhou Yunsheng fixed his gaze on the pale, weary man.

“Yunsheng? I feel like I’ve heard that name before.” The Crown Prince appeared stunned.

Zhou Yunsheng almost rushed over to grab his clothes and ask when he had heard the name, but he restrained himself in time. That person was just a string of data. Death meant forever disappearing. How could he have come after him? And how could Sinián have heard of Zhou Yunsheng?

He forced himself to suppress the fluttering in his heart and said solemnly, “Your Highness, don’t worry, your health will improve. I will find a way.” Although the world doesn’t have any miraculous medicine, the female protagonist has a spiritual spring that can cleanse the bones and reshape the body. He will find a way to bring it to the Crown Prince, sooner or later.

The young man’s eyes were so clear, and his voice so firm, as if those words were his faith, something he would carry out with all his might. The Crown Prince suddenly felt that, even if he had selfish motives for helping him, it was enough that he stood there.

“I will remember your words. As long as I am alive, the Shen family will live on.”

Three years later,

The Crown Prince, bedridden from illness, had finally recovered, though his body had become much thinner, and his skin had turned as pale as paper. His eyes were deep and endless, his lips thin and blood-red, and even when silent, his mere presence seemed to make the air oppressive.

He was no longer as unpredictable as before. He had taken on several tasks appointed by Emperor Tianchen, handling them with great skill. Even though there were those watching him closely, they could find no fault. After months of observation, Emperor Tianchen finally relaxed.

One day, torrential rains in the Liangjiang region led to severe flooding, submerging countless cities and leaving the people homeless and in despair. The ministers petitioned Emperor Tianchen, asking for a decision. After some deliberation, the Emperor appointed the Crown Prince and the Seventh Prince to handle the situation in Liangjiang.

Because the Crown Prince had been ruthless in dealing with the princes, the others could not stand against him. Only the filial and humble Seventh Prince had managed to avoid a similar fate. If they handled this matter well, it would be a great opportunity to gain favor in front of the Emperor.

The Seventh Prince was greatly pleased and, on the surface, obeyed the Crown Prince. However, upon returning, he secretly discussed with his advisors how to stand out.

Zhou Yunsheng, now promoted to Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Works, was also accompanying them.

After a long journey, they finally arrived in Liangjiang, where the floods were still wreaking havoc. Yu Baotian, the Governor of Liangjiang, personally went to the disaster areas to comfort the people and inspect the damage. Upon hearing that the Crown Prince had arrived, he hurriedly set up a banquet at his residence to welcome him.

It was called a banquet, but in truth, it was little more than a shabby round table with some broken bowls and cold steamed buns, accompanied by a few pickled vegetables. Without tea, it would have been difficult to swallow.

Upon seeing this, the Crown Prince's expression darkened, but the Seventh Prince remained unperturbed.

Yu Baotian feigned ignorance and respectfully served the Crown Prince a cold, hard bun along with some pickled vegetables, saying, "Due to the floods blocking the roads, the supply of food in Kun City has been exhausted, and we are unable to find any good wine to accompany your meal. Please do not be offended."

Having given up his addiction to cold food powder, the Crown Prince had not indulged in alcohol for a long time. However, in the eyes of the public, he was still the same debauched Crown Prince who could not live without wine. Yu Baotian, known for his integrity, had criticized the Crown Prince's unruly behavior in the past and had even submitted petitions to depose him, making him a thorn in the Crown Prince's side.

The two men, who despised each other, immediately clashed in subtle ways.

The Crown Prince remained expressionless, but there was a flicker of hostility in his eyes.

The Seventh Prince, waiting for the Crown Prince to take action, said nothing. Yu Baotian was one of the most capable ministers in the Great Zhou, and the Emperor's confidant. This disaster relief mission was of great importance, and if the Crown Prince were to punish his most capable assistant right away, the mission would surely fail. This would give the Seventh Prince the chance to rise to prominence.

Just as the Crown Prince was about to speak, his left hand, resting on the table, was suddenly grasped by a warm and delicate hand. His mind wavered, but he betrayed no emotion, glancing quickly at Zhou Yunsheng, who was sitting beside him.

Three years had passed, and the young man had just reached adulthood. His features had matured slightly, making him even more handsome, like a flawless jade. His eyes, shimmering like water, gave him a look that seemed to say "be patient." The simple glance made the Crown Prince’s heart flutter, and he felt a strange itch.

He instinctively took hold of the hand and gently squeezed it. Then he slowly spoke, "Minister Yu is not in the capital and does not know that I have been sober for years. Now that the people are suffering, I feel their pain. Even if I were to drink, it would feel like a stone in my throat, and the food would have no taste. I can still eat a few cold buns, but how many people have already reached the point of eating their own children? Clear the table. Take the food I brought and distribute it to all the counties. Saving people is like putting out a fire—every second counts."

Yu Baotian was stunned, unable to believe that the words were coming from the hedonistic Crown Prince. The Seventh Prince stared at his brother in disbelief.

While they were both in shock, the Crown Prince picked up two buns, handing one to Zhou Yunsheng and keeping the other for himself, walking away hastily, eating as he went.



===================================================================

Chapter 3.7

After walking out of the sight of the two behind them, the Crown Prince took Zhou Yunsheng's hand, his expression gentle.

"What's wrong? Were you worried that I would lose my temper just now?"

"It was my fault, Your Highness. You are wise and powerful; how could you let others find fault with you? I truly have nothing to offer you, and I feel ashamed."

These words were not merely Zhou Yunsheng’s humility. Once the Crown Prince regained his composure, his sharp tactics came back as well. Without anyone reminding him, he was able to firmly secure his position as the heir apparent, often making Zhou Yunsheng feel like he was unnecessary. Many times, Zhou Yunsheng wondered if the Crown Prince who had lost his place in the Eastern Palace in both lifetimes due to being plotted against was the same person as the one in front of him now.

The Crown Prince laughed loudly, pinched the young man's fingertips, and whispered, "Your appearance is the greatest help to me. Without you, there would be no 'me' today." He paused slightly, affectionately caressing the young man's cheek, his voice becoming even lower. "I am always grateful that the heavens brought you to my side. You worry about me, and that makes me very happy." He was extremely happy.

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his head and said, "I dare not." The times were different, and so were their identities, so his approach to emotions was also different. Although this person often stirred up familiar emotions in him, he would not rashly take the next step. Shen Yibin’s wish was to see the Shen family prosper and his loved ones safe and joyful. If he made even a slight misstep, those wishes would turn to bubbles.

The Crown Prince noticed his lack of response and wanted to say something more, but hearing footsteps behind him, he had to stop.

Yu Baotian initially thought that the Crown Prince was only putting on an act and would not be able to hold on for long. However, unexpectedly, the Crown Prince visited the embankment daily to assess the danger, personally went to the disaster area to comfort the people, and worked late into the night reviewing all the memorials from various states and counties. The devastated areas in the two rivers gradually regained vitality.

He thought about the people's suffering, shared their pain, and hurried to alleviate their worries. He gave up his luxury and rested day and night, losing weight to the point of looking almost unrecognizable. Yu Baotian watched this and was moved, no longer holding the biased attitude he had towards the Crown Prince. Every three days, he sent memorials to the capital, detailing the Crown Prince’s deeds, praising him with heartfelt admiration. This greatly pleased Emperor Tianchen.

The Crown Prince's capability made the Seventh Prince seem all the more mediocre. The Seventh Prince, in a fit of anxiety, could not help but resort to some underhanded tactics.

One day, the Governor of the Two Rivers, Wang Bin, hosted a banquet for the Crown Prince at his official residence.

Wang Bin was a subordinate of the Crown Prince, and his daughter was a concubine in the Eastern Palace, enjoying quite a bit of favor. Therefore, his relationship with the Crown Prince was very close. It was also Wang Bin’s influence that led to the Crown Prince being deposed in his first life.

In the first life, the Crown Prince did not fall victim to the poison of the Cold Food Powder, but the flattery of others was just as toxic. The Crown Prince's life had been smooth sailing, and over time, he became increasingly arrogant, with weaker supervision over his subordinates. No matter how strong a person was, they could easily be defeated when surrounded by incompetent allies, and Wang Bin was one of the worst.

Wang Bin was very greedy and had embezzled money allocated by the court for reinforcing the embankment for seven or eight years, leaving the embankment as fragile as paper, ready to collapse with a single poke. When the Crown Prince was ordered to go for disaster relief, Wang Bin feared that the Crown Prince would discover this and embezzled eighty percent of the disaster relief funds to offer them to the Crown Prince. He even sent two beautiful women to seduce the Crown Prince.

When the Crown Prince and the beautiful women were caught in the act, a heavy rainstorm was about to hit outside, causing the embankment at the upper reaches of the two rivers to collapse, sending torrents of floodwaters sweeping through countless towns and people, with the disaster being catastrophic. When the Crown Prince was rescued from the official residence, he was not even wearing pants, exposing himself in a very embarrassing manner.

The news quickly reached the capital, and Emperor Tianchen's fury was unimaginable. The Crown Prince was naturally deposed.

In the second life, the situation was even worse with the Cold Food Powder. The Crown Prince's actions became even more foolish, and he was quickly disposed of without any of the earlier formalities, sentenced to eternal downfall. After his death, he was neither given a posthumous title nor allowed to enter the imperial tombs, with an utterly tragic end.

But when Zhou Yunsheng arrived, the situation changed greatly. After enduring the torment of the Cold Food Powder, the Crown Prince became more intelligent and patient, constantly feeling the threat of danger and never daring to relax. He was strict with his subordinates, and three years ago, he had already noticed Wang Bin's actions. He ordered Wang Bin to return the embezzled funds and had the embankments reinforced year after year.

Thus, even with continuous rain for dozens of days, the embankment at the upper reaches remained firm and unbreakable. Meanwhile, in the capital, Xie Yuru did not know about the Crown Prince's secret actions and was silently waiting for the disaster to strike. In fact, the Crown Prince's sharp vigilance and flawless tactics were thanks to Xie Yuru’s influence.

Although Wang Bin was not as foolish as in the first life, his servile nature could not be changed. As soon as the Crown Prince had a free moment, Wang Bin eagerly hosted a banquet, trying to strengthen their bond. His daughter had not been favored even once in the past three years, so how could he not be anxious?

Wang Bin, being an important official, had to be given some face, so the Crown Prince attended the banquet on time and exchanged a few encouraging words. Fortunately, Wang Bin was tactful and did not make the banquet too extravagant. It consisted of just a few simple dishes. However, the women accompanying them at the table caught the Crown Prince's eye.

There was no other reason, except that these women were extraordinarily beautiful, with delicate figures, shining eyes, and graceful manners, all of which attracted the attention of everyone present. It was one thing to serve the Crown Prince, but the two women placed by Wang Bin next to Shen Yibin were exchanging glances and acting provocatively, which made the Crown Prince feel disturbed.

After enduring for a while, the Crown Prince finally lost his temper when he saw one of the women giggling and falling into Shen Yibin’s arms. He angrily overturned the banquet table, grabbed the young man, and left, leaving behind a cryptic remark, "The feasts of rich families stink, while the bones of the frozen on the road are visible."

Wang Bin turned pale with fear, and after hearing this, Yu Baotian laughed heartily and praised the Crown Prince’s wisdom, calling him a great blessing to the country. He then wrote this incident in a memorial to report to Emperor Tianchen.

After reading it, Emperor Tianchen was delighted.

After the Crown Prince pulled the young man into the carriage, he still had not calmed down from his anger. His chest rose and fell, as if a wild beast was trying to break free.

"Your Highness, you cannot be too agitated; your body won’t be able to take it," Zhou Yunsheng sighed and pulled out a pill, offering it to the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince’s eyes were dark and bright, and deep affection swirled in his pupils. He gazed at the young man for a moment before opening his mouth, taking the pill and Zhou Yunsheng’s finger into his mouth, teasing it with his tongue.

Zhou Yunsheng immediately withdrew his fingertip and lowered his head, remaining silent.

The Crown Prince clenched his fist, wanting to pull him into his embrace, to tear off his unadorned robe and forcibly possess him, to pry open his mouth and suck his soul along with his saliva. But he only thought about it, not acting on it.

He knew he didn't have much time left. If the young man were to be labeled as a flatterer, his career would be ruined. The only thing he could do now was to ascend to the throne, climb to that supreme seat, and protect the young man under his wings, giving him a bright, smooth, and unwavering path ahead.

At this thought, an overwhelming sadness and helplessness filled his heart. The Crown Prince sighed deeply, caressed the young man's cheek, and leaned back in despair.

Zhou Yunsheng’s heart tightened with a sharp pang, and the lingering pain made him frown deeply.

When the Crown Prince left the Two Rivers, tens of thousands of people lined the streets to send him off. Some knelt, others cried, and the scene was deeply moving. People from all counties sent umbrellas, which, when opened, nearly blocked out the sky. The Crown Prince, the heir apparent, had finally gained the recognition of everyone.

The Seventh Prince had been waiting for the Crown Prince to use some weak pawns to create flaws in his work, but unexpectedly, the Crown Prince reprimanded Wang Bin, which only elevated the heir’s reputation even further. The Seventh Prince could find no fault and had to retreat.

In the capital, Xie Yuru was stunned to see that the embankment at Jianghuai had remained intact and that the Crown Prince was so wise and capable. The panic in her heart was beyond words.

In this life, her ultimate goal was to become the Empress Dowager, the most respected woman in the Great Zhou. If the Seventh Prince did not ascend to the throne, what was the point of her rebirth? In her first life, she had risen to the second-rank consort position, but in this life, even as a side consort to a Prince, she was worse off than her first life, especially since her enemy, Shen Qiaodan, was living a smooth and prosperous life.

Every time she thought of the potential for change in the future, Xie Yuru’s heart burned with anxiety, and she could not sleep at night. Fortunately, she knew there was still one perfect opportunity to eliminate the Crown Prince, which calmed her down.

Because the Prince had been overworked with the government documents, his health deteriorated, and the convoy was moving slowly. Before they even left the boundaries of Liangjiang, the Seventh Prince suddenly fell ill, and not long after, the Crown Prince also fell unconscious.

"This... this is an outbreak of pestilence, we must isolate them and take care of them!" The imperial physician cried out in panic after checking their pulses.

The guards quickly requisitioned a local wealthy family’s courtyard to house the two princes and sent a letter back to the capital to report the matter. Emperor Tianchen was greatly shocked and immediately dispatched several imperial physicians, along with several carts of precious medicines, to Liangjiang.

Both the Crown Prince's East Palace and the Seventh Prince's residence sent one of their concubines to attend to the sick. In the first life, the Seventh Prince had also contracted the pestilence, and it was Shen Qiaodan who took care of him, thus forming a deep bond between them. In this life, Xie Yuruo had already prepared to attend to the sick, while Shen Qiaodan, who had no affection for the Seventh Prince, naturally didn't compete with her.

The Crown Prince, who had already been weakened by the cold food powder, was struck hard by the pestilence, and his condition deteriorated rapidly to the brink of death. The Seventh Prince was destined to go through this calamity, and he fell ill even earlier than the Crown Prince, with no better outlook.

Zhou Yunsheng took care of the unconscious Crown Prince every day. When the concubine, Wang, arrived, he had no choice but to withdraw to the side hall.

No sooner had he left than the Crown Prince woke up. When he saw the figure at his bedside, a fleeting look of disappointment passed through his eyes. He asked in a low voice, "Where is Yunsheng?"

Wang covered her mouth and nose with a handkerchief and cautiously asked, "Who is Yunsheng?"

The personal attendant answered on behalf of the Crown Prince, "Your Highness, Lord Shen has taken care of you day and night for four days. When Concubine Wang arrived, he left."

The disappointment in the Crown Prince's eyes faded away. He smiled slightly and pointed at Wang. "I don’t want her. Bring Yunsheng here."

Wang was only too happy to comply and quickly followed the attendant out.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Chapter 3.8

Zhou Yunsheng had powerful spiritual energy, and not only could he go without sleep for four days, but he could also go without sleep for four months if necessary. Therefore, after returning to his room, he did not rush to rest, but instead stood by the window, lost in thought.

He was waiting, waiting for Xie Yuruo’s medicinal space and spiritual spring. As long as Xie Yuruo arrived, he could guarantee the Crown Prince’s safety. Would Xie Yuruo come? The answer was, of course, yes.

Thinking of this, he squinted and smiled.

“Lord Shen, His Royal Highness has summoned you.” The personal attendant thought that he was having trouble sleeping due to his worry for the Crown Prince and couldn't help but feel grateful.

Upon hearing this, Zhou Yunsheng immediately headed towards the main hall.

“Your Highness.” He slowly walked to the bedside and bowed.

“It’s already this late, yet you still call me ‘Your Highness’? Call me Siyan,” the Crown Prince said, trying to prop himself up so he could observe the young man’s face.

Zhou Yunsheng hurriedly helped him sit up, placing a soft pillow behind him. Obediently, he called out, “Siyan.” The moment he spoke the name, it seemed to close the distance between them, causing their faces to soften.

The Crown Prince smiled quietly, grasping one of his hands, calling out “Yunsheng” once, and then again, as if not calling out a second time would mean never having the chance again.

“You said, if anything happened to me, you would accompany me to the underworld. Does that still stand?” He finally regretted it, all the things he said about smoothing his path and pushing him forward had been self-deception. He was so selfish that even if it meant going to hell, he wanted to hold on to the person in front of him.

Zhou Yunsheng was not afraid of anything, let alone death. If his task in this world was unfinished, he could just go to the next world, then the next, it was no big deal. After thinking for a moment, he smiled and nodded, “I remember, that promise will always stand.”

The Crown Prince’s eyes brightened, and he coughed, laughing loudly. His laughter was unlike any before, full of joy.

Several palace maids and attendants turned away, red-eyed, wiping away their tears.

From then on, Zhou Yunsheng never left the Crown Prince’s side. They ate, drank, and rested together, never fearing the risk of infection from the pestilence. Though he said he would go with the Crown Prince to the underworld, he knew that after his body had been modified, unless he chose to leave, he could live for a long time. The Crown Prince would also never die from the pestilence.

Xie Yuruo finally arrived at the manor. Upon hearing that the Crown Prince was already gravely ill, she secretly sighed in relief and coldly sneered, "Even if you escaped the fate of being deposed, so what? Heaven has decreed that you cannot ascend to the throne, so you will be compensated here. If you’re not destined for wealth and nobility, why struggle to the death?"

She kowtowed outside the Crown Prince’s courtyard before eagerly heading to care for the Seventh Prince.

The Seventh Prince was indeed very moved when he saw her risk her life to come. He grabbed her hand and refused to let go. Xie Yuruo gently comforted him, and then she added spiritual spring water to the Seventh Prince’s medicine, tea, and meals, even using the lotus seeds from the spiritual spring for him to chew.

To prevent the servants who had accompanied her from contracting the pestilence, she generously added spiritual spring water to the large tea cups they drank from.

The effect of the spiritual spring was extraordinary. The Seventh Prince recovered day by day, and none of the servants in his courtyard fell ill. In contrast, at the Crown Prince’s courtyard, almost every day, bodies were carried out. The Crown Prince himself spent more time unconscious than awake, and it seemed he was about to succumb.

Since both princes used the same medicine, the physicians had no doubts and simply assumed that the Crown Prince’s weaker constitution was the cause of his deteriorating health.

One day, after taking care of the Crown Prince, Zhou Yunsheng slipped his hand out of the Crown Prince’s grip and slowly made his way to the Seventh Prince’s courtyard.

“Concubine, please save the Crown Prince.” After paying his respects to the Seventh Prince, who lay on the sickbed, he deeply bowed to Xie Yuruo, who stood by the side.

Several physicians, who were in the room rechecking the Seventh Prince, looked on in surprise.

Xie Yuruo was shocked but did not show it on her face. She asked in confusion, “Lord Shen, what is this about? I, as a concubine, am not skilled in medicine. How could I possibly save the Crown Prince?”

“Concubine, you are too humble. The Seventh Prince’s recovery is entirely thanks to your spiritual medicine. The Crown Prince is the heir to the throne, and you clearly have the medicine, yet you keep it a secret. Seeing His Highness near death, how is this any different from treason?” Zhou Yunsheng smiled, but his words were like knives, almost shattering Xie Yuruo’s soul.

“Lord Shen, you are joking. Where would I have spiritual medicine? All my luggage is here, and the physicians are present. They can search through it. If any spiritual medicine is found, I am willing to submit myself to execution. Treason is a crime punishable by extermination of nine generations. If Lord Shen has no evidence, it would be best not to speak recklessly.”

Xie Yuruo, relying on the space she carried, quickly regained her composure.

Zhou Yunsheng chuckled, “If I didn’t have absolute certainty, I would never be so disrespectful. To be honest, my nose is different from others. I can smell scents that ordinary people cannot. If you want proof, I can provide some.”

He pointed to the sachet hanging from Xie Yuruo’s waist and said, “This sachet contains Bai Zhi, Chuanxiong, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Gan Song, five qian each, with additional Shanxian, Xuncao, Zelan, and Ai Ye, two qian each. These are the most common herbs in a sachet, and you could argue that I’m guessing blindly, but this sachet has a hidden mystery. It also contains a piece of ginseng and a lotus seed. The scent of the ginseng is very unique; it’s a scent I’ve never smelled in my life. I boldly guess it’s the legendary purple skin ginseng, which has long been extinct. As for the lotus seed, it’s even more amazing. Just a hint of its fragrance makes me feel intoxicated and unable to tell what day it is. I am well-versed in medicine and have read countless books, but I still can’t figure out its variety or origin.”

He then walked slowly to the table, picked up the Seventh Prince’s medicine bowl, and sniffed it. He smiled and said, “This bowl of medicine contains the scent of that ginseng and lotus seed, as well as a refreshing water fragrance, which seems to be filled with spiritual energy.”

Putting down the bowl, he noticed the lotus pods in the fruit basket, still unpeeled, and his eyes brightened. He sighed, “So it’s such extraordinary lotus seeds. Concubine, you really have many of them. You are indeed powerful.”

After walking around the room, he finally stopped by the window, pointed to the small stove where the teapot was bubbling with white smoke, and his voice shifted from soft to cold. “Even the tea for the servants contains spiritual medicine, but you won’t spare a drop for His Highness. Concubine, what exactly are you planning?”

Xie Yuru tightly clenched her fists, drenched in sweat. She never imagined that her medical space and spiritual spring would be exposed because of a dog's nose. At this moment, she was already flustered, but still tried to argue, "So many imperial doctors are here, yet only Master Shen can detect the strange smell. Master Shen's ability to make baseless claims really opened my eyes. I’ve already said I don't have any spiritual medicine. Feel free to search everything, and if you find even the slightest trace, I’ll admit my guilt."

The Seventh Prince snapped out of his shock and said solemnly, "Then let's search." He and Xie Yuru were in perfect sync. Seeing her determined gaze, he remained calm and unruffled.

Zhou Yunsheng seemed to find it laughable and clapped his hands, laughing, "Why would I search your luggage? Just take back the medicine bowl, fruit basket, teapot, and the sachet. Madam, if the Prince is fine, I’ll come to apologize later. If the Prince does not survive, I’ll accompany him to the underworld, but it seems I won’t be able to come back. I’ll take my leave now. Please, Your Highness and Madam, rest well."

He bowed, and as he straightened up, he pulled off Xie Yuru's sachet, ordered the servants to remove the bowls, fruit basket, teapot, and other items, and called upon several imperial doctors to leave in full view.

The medical space and spiritual spring were divine objects, existing in an unseen alternate space. At first, Xie Yuru could barely believe it herself, so how could she have imagined that it would be discovered? As the group walked further away, she collapsed like a pile of mud. When she met the Seventh Prince's inscrutable gaze, she only felt that the road ahead was dark.

Zhou Yunsheng returned to the main courtyard, where the Prince had not yet regained consciousness. Several imperial doctors followed him, incredulous, asking, "Infected with the plague, one has little chance of survival. Can these things really save His Highness? Master Shen, are you sure you aren’t mistaken?"

"You'll know once it's used."

Zhou Yunsheng opened the sachet, took out a ginseng slice and a lotus seed, placed them in the medicine bowl, and ordered the servants to peel all the lotus pods for use in the tea tray. He then gently propped up the Prince and softly called his name.

"Yunsheng, I feel like I might not make it. Bring me pen and paper; I need to write a letter to Father. Don't worry, even if I die, I will ensure that the Shen family remains strong for a hundred years." The Prince spoke weakly.

"Your Highness will be fine today," Zhou Yunsheng said as he combed the Prince's messy hair. He then picked up the medicine bowl and whispered, "This is the spiritual medicine I got from the Xie family. Drink it, and you’ll feel better immediately."

The Prince thought he was being comforted, but still smiled and obediently drank the medicine, then tried to suppress the urge to vomit as he chewed the lotus seeds, drinking the tea to wash it down.

The imperial doctors watched in astonishment but did not share Master Shen’s confidence. They silently wondered: how could a plague, such a fatal disease, be cured by just a bowl of medicine, a few cups of tea, and some lotus seeds? Master Shen, worried about the Prince, must have gone mad. He had just offended the Seventh Prince and his favored concubine. When the Seventh Prince ascended to the throne, the future of the Shen family would be bleak!

However, a miracle happened. After the Prince consumed everything, he immediately broke out into a heavy sweat. The sweat was black, reeking with a strong odor, as if all the toxins in his body had been expelled. Soon after, the Prince needed to relieve himself several times, took a hot bath, and when he looked in the mirror, his complexion was rosy, his eyes bright, and he seemed full of energy.

The effect was so remarkable that it seemed almost too good to be true. Not to mention the spiritual spring and purple ginseng, the medicinal power of the Nine-Tier Golden Lotus was extraordinary. Xie Yuru had controlled the dosage on the Seventh Prince's side, only allowing him to consume one lotus seed a day, so his recovery appeared slower compared to the Prince, who had chewed dozens of seeds in one go.

The Nine-Tier Golden Lotus bloomed in the spiritual spring, and each lotus seed absorbed the concentrated essence of the spring water, making it highly effective. Xie Yuru had been careless and took out five or six pods at once, which allowed Zhou Yunsheng to achieve his goal of purging the Prince's body.

"Check my pulse." The Prince, with his hair wet, placed his wrist on the pulse pillow, his voice full of strength.

The doctors took turns feeling his pulse, astonished by its vigor.

Wang Shi rushed to the scene, holding a dry handkerchief, wanting to dry the Prince's hair.

"You don’t need to appear before me again, you coward who fears death," the Prince said coldly, narrowing his eyes. Then he looked at Zhou Yunsheng, who was standing beside him, and smiled brightly, "Yunsheng, come here, my hair is wet, it’s so cold."

His tone was so childishly coquettish that Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t help but get goosebumps. He had no choice but to walk over and assist.

Wang Shi's face turned pale with a mix of disbelief and sorrow.

After all the doctors had checked the pulse, they all shouted in unison, "Your Highness is now safe! The medicine from the Xie family is indeed miraculous!"

From being a respectful concubine, Xie Yuru’s status had now fallen to one of disrespect, and her tragic future became apparent. She clearly had the medicine but refused to use it for the Prince. This would surely reach the Emperor’s ears. Not only would Xie Yuru suffer, but the Seventh Prince might also lose his favor. The Prince was the heir to the throne of the Great Zhou. The couple’s inaction in saving him would be considered regicide, a crime that would destroy both families.
