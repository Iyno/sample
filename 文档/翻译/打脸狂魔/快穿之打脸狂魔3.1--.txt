Chapter 3.1

The male protagonist and the female protagonist hadn’t even exchanged a single word, let alone been together, and the second world had already completely broken free from the control of the Main God. When Zhou Yunsheng returned to the Starsea Space, he discovered that his soul power had become even stronger than before, and he vaguely realized—whenever he disrupted a space, he would absorb the power contained within it.

This method of sustaining life was identical to that of the Main God. Perhaps one day, when his power surpassed the Main God’s, he would be able to break free from these shackles and return to reality.

However, this speculation did not excite Zhou Yunsheng. On the contrary, he greatly enjoyed every moment of opposing the Main God.

Because the energy he absorbed was too vast, he fell into a dormant state. When he woke up again, two brand-new galaxies had appeared in the Starsea Space.

Zhou Yunsheng stood amidst the galaxies for a long time before finally pressing the teleportation button. When he opened his eyes again, he found himself sitting in a simple cubicle, with no one around. In front of him was a small wooden desk, upon which lay a blank sheet of white paper, a brush, and an inkstone.

Had he arrived in ancient times? He tugged at the luxurious brocade robe he was wearing and then clicked on the smart device on his wrist. A brief description of this world and detailed information about the original owner appeared on the screen.

This was the Gongyuan (examination hall) of the Great Zhou Dynasty, and it was currently the triennial Spring Imperial Examination. The original owner had successfully passed the prefectural, county, academy, and provincial examinations, reaching the metropolitan examination. If he passed, he would qualify for the final palace examination.

The original owner was named Shen Yibin, the legitimate eldest son of Shen Hui, Minister of Personnel. He was usually gluttonous and lazy, with mediocre scholarly abilities. The fact that he had managed to pass all the previous exams and reach the metropolitan examination was actually thanks to the female protagonist of this world.

The female protagonist was named Xie Yurou, a side concubine of the Seventh Prince, Zhu Ziqing. In her previous life, she had died tragically in the Cold Palace, but now she had been reborn and had obtained a miraculous medical space and a spiritual spring that could cure all diseases and enhance beauty.

Shen Yibin’s legitimate sister, Shen Qiaodan, was also a side concubine of the Seventh Prince. In their past life, she was Xie Yurou’s mortal enemy. After giving birth to the prince’s eldest legitimate son, she outshone Xie Yurou and became the main wife. When the Seventh Prince ascended the throne, her son was made the crown prince, and she became the empress. As the loser in their rivalry, Xie Yurou was repeatedly demoted and eventually died of illness in the Cold Palace. It was only before her death that she discovered her long-term infertility was Shen Qiaodan’s doing.

Logically speaking, after being reborn, Xie Yurou should have sought revenge against the Shen family. Why, then, would she secretly help Shen Yibin? Naturally, this was all part of a scheme.

With knowledge of future events, Xie Yurou had someone leak the exam questions to Shen Yibin, allowing him to pass all the previous exams and reach the metropolitan examination. However, this year’s examination would be embroiled in a major cheating scandal—the emperor’s personal eunuch had recorded the exam questions and sold them outside the palace. The crown prince’s retainers saw this as an excellent opportunity for profit and collaborated in taking massive bribes.

The examinees who obtained the exam questions in advance, eager to ensure a high ranking, spent large sums of money hiring talented scholars to compose essays for them. They memorized the essays before the exam and simply transcribed them once inside the examination hall. As a result, this year’s metropolitan examination produced numerous stunningly eloquent essays, greatly pleasing Emperor Tianchen.

The problem, however, lay in the fact that there were only so many truly talented individuals available. Since multiple examinees sought help from the same scholars, identical essays inevitably appeared.

After discovering seven or eight identical exam papers in a row, Emperor Tianchen’s delight turned into fury. He immediately ordered the Minister of Personnel to work with the Court of Judicial Review to investigate the matter.

That year, all examinees who had purchased the exam questions were stripped of their qualifications and sent back to their hometowns. Many noble sons in the capital were involved, leading to their fathers being dismissed from office by the emperor and permanently barred from holding official positions. This marked the beginning of the crown prince’s downfall and provided the Seventh Prince with an opportunity to seize the throne.

In the previous life, Shen Yibin had never even passed the preliminary county-level exam, let alone the metropolitan examination. His father, Shen Hui, had gained favor with the emperor by uncovering the cheating scandal and eventually rose to the position of Grand Chancellor, wielding immense power. Without Shen Hui’s support, the Seventh Prince would not have been able to elevate Shen Qiaodan to the position of main wife.

In this life, however, Xie Yurou secretly assisted Shen Yibin in passing all the previous exams, just to ensure that he would participate in this year’s metropolitan examination and then be stripped of his qualifications—thus ruining Shen Hui’s political career.

Without the Shen family’s influence, Shen Qiaodan would no longer be a threat.

Zhou Yunsheng had arrived neither too early nor too late—he appeared just as Shen Yibin had purchased the exam questions, memorized the answers, and was about to begin writing. Now, he had only two choices.

One was to forfeit the exam and leave early. However, the crown prince’s retainers possessed a ledger that recorded the names of all examinees who had bought the questions. Even if he submitted a blank paper, he would still be implicated once the ledger was exposed.

The second option was to abandon the memorized essay and write a groundbreaking, awe-inspiring answer.

Emperor Tianchen was desperate for talent. He had once spent a fortune acquiring a good horse and even greater sums recruiting brilliant minds. If someone was truly a learned scholar, the emperor might be willing to overlook the scandal.

But just how exceptional would an essay have to be to impress the emperor and avoid disaster?

As Zhou Yunsheng pondered, he glanced at the exam paper. The question was surprisingly simple—just three characters: "Zuyongdiao" (the tax system). It was indeed characteristic of Emperor Tianchen’s straightforward, pragmatic, and sharp examination style.

Zuyongdiao was the current taxation system of the Great Zhou Dynasty, based on the Equal-Field System. However, due to increasing land annexation, a growing number of independent farmers were going bankrupt, fleeing, or becoming tenant farmers under landlords, pushing the Equal-Field System to the brink of collapse. With its foundation crumbling, the Zuyongdiao tax system was also in peril.

It not only increased the burden on the common people, leading to widespread hardship, but also failed to generate sufficient revenue to sustain government operations. Emperor Tianchen was currently troubled over how to reform the tax system.

Zhou Yunsheng was well-versed in literature, calligraphy, chess, and music, and with the powerful search engine of his smart device, composing a masterpiece was effortless. He simply closed his eyes briefly, and when he reopened them, his brush moved fluidly, creating bold and powerful strokes that penetrated the paper.

What was even more astonishing than the calligraphy itself was the content of the essay—not only did it analyze the flaws of the Zuyongdiao system, but it also proposed a more advanced Two-Tax Law.

This new system abandoned the old method of taxing individuals and instead levied taxes based on property, establishing the principle of “taxing assets rather than people.” It not only increased government revenue but also alleviated the tax burden on the people. This reform laid the foundation for future taxation systems and was a significant milestone in history.

After completing his essay, Zhou Yunsheng briefly reviewed it before closing his eyes to recall Shen Yibin’s life. In the previous life, Shen Yibin was stripped of his titles and banned from future examinations, while his father, Shen Hui, was dismissed, leading to the rapid decline of the Shen family. Meanwhile, Xie Yurou rose to power, eventually becoming the Empress Dowager.

Now, not only did Zhou Yunsheng have to help Shen Yibin avoid this crisis, but he also had to turn the tide and restore the Shen family’s glory.

So how should he proceed? Should he assist the Seventh Prince and claim the merit of supporting the future emperor?

Zhou Yunsheng shook his head slightly, dismissing the idea. Instead of letting Xie Yurou benefit, why not support a different prince?


The Tianchen Emperor had twelve sons, but he favored the crown prince the most, as he was both the eldest and the legitimate heir. Perhaps having been flattered and elevated too high, the crown prince had become increasingly reckless in recent years. This corruption case marked the beginning of the emperor’s waning patience with him.

If the crown prince could steady himself, regaining the emperor’s favor would not be difficult. And if that were the case, how could the other princes have any chance to rise? The question was whether he could still be saved. It would be best to observe first—if he was beyond redemption, then another candidate would have to be found.

With these thoughts in mind, Zhou Yunsheng unknowingly drifted off to sleep, causing the patrolling officials to shake their heads in disapproval.

After the metropolitan examination, the chief examiners worked tirelessly day and night to grade the papers. Since this year’s examination questions pertained to the fate of the nation, the Tianchen Emperor, while testing the scholars, also sought to gather insights. Thus, he personally visited the examination hall to inspect the papers.

One of the chief examiners presented a paper with a deep bow and said, "Your Majesty, please take a look. This essay is worthy of the top rank!"

"I too have an exceptional one here," another examiner offered as he presented a different paper.

The Tianchen Emperor took both papers and, with just a brief glance, was full of praise.

While he was reviewing them, the examiners continued their grading. Suddenly, one of them accidentally knocked over an inkstone, his face filled with horror.

"What is the matter?" The emperor turned to him slowly.

"Your Majesty, this paper… it is identical to the one before!" The examiner’s face turned ashen, fully aware that this meant the exam questions had been leaked, and someone had arranged for answers to be written on behalf of multiple candidates.

The emperor’s eyes darkened. He quickly scanned through the essay and spoke with an unprecedented coldness, "Find them—bring me all the identical papers at once!"

The examiners dared not delay and immediately began searching through the stack of papers. It did not take long before they uncovered eight or nine identical essays. Just then, another examiner picked up a paper and stared at it in stunned silence, his fingers trembling slightly.

Seeing this, the emperor strode over. His face was clouded with fury, ready for a storm—but after reading just two lines, he was completely taken aback. As he continued reading, his expression changed from shock to delight, and by the end, he was so overjoyed that he slapped the table and laughed aloud.

"Good! Good! Good! I never expected that our Great Zhou would produce such a prodigious talent, and that I would be fortunate enough to witness it! This is truly a blessing!"

In his excitement, the emperor disregarded protocol and directly unsealed the anonymous submission to check the candidate’s name—Shen Yibin?

Shen Yibin? The name sounded familiar.

"Your Majesty, Shen Yibin is the eldest legitimate son of Lord Shen Hui," an examiner answered, ending with a sigh.

This young man was infamous in the capital for his lack of discipline and learning. If he were truly capable of composing such a masterpiece, then all the other scholars might as well hang themselves in shame. It had to be another case of someone writing the essay on his behalf.

The emperor had the same thought as the examiners. His face darkened instantly, and he ordered in a stern voice, "Arrest Shen Yibin immediately! Find out who wrote the essay for him!"



======================================================


Chapter 3.2
Shen Yibin was the only legitimate son of the Shen family and was therefore highly favored. Everything he ate, wore, and used was of the finest quality available. After returning to the Shen household, Zhou Yunsheng enjoyed a few carefree and comfortable days, but little did he expect that one morning, he would be thrown into the imperial prison by the Imperial Guards.

Shen’s father, being a close minister of the emperor, naturally had access to the examination questions. Emperor Tianchen suspected that Shen’s father was also involved in the cheating scandal and ordered the Imperial Guards to detain him as well.

Now, father and son sat together in a foul-smelling prison cell, their faces pale and haggard, with dark circles under their eyes, looking utterly exhausted.

"When is Mother bringing us food? I haven’t had Eight-Treasure Duck in so long, and I’m craving it badly." Zhou Yunsheng held a piece of straw between his lips while rubbing his backside, which had just been caned. Fortunately, he had always maintained a habit of strengthening his body, or he would have suffered internal injuries by now.

Shen’s father, still holding his official position and thus exempt from physical punishment, suffered mentally far worse than any beating. He grabbed his son’s ear and scolded angrily, "You unfilial son! How can you still think about food at a time like this? Just confess the name of the person who wrote the exam for you and spare yourself further suffering!"

"But I wrote it myself. How can I confess to something that never happened?" Zhou Yunsheng covered his ear, looking aggrieved.

Seeing his son still refusing to admit fault even in such dire straits, Shen’s father was overwhelmed with fury and began beating him soundly.

Meanwhile, Madam Shen was visiting her daughter, who was the concubine of the Seventh Prince.

"Mother, you should leave. I am barely able to protect myself now—how can I possibly save Father and my brother? I’ve already sent people to request an audience several times, but the Seventh Prince refuses to see me. He must have guessed my intentions, for he even had Mother Consort summon me to the palace for a harsh reprimand. I am now under house arrest, and who knows when I’ll be free again?" Shen Qiaodan wept bitterly, her face full of despair.

Madam Shen suddenly understood. After a moment of silence, she sighed. "So, the Seventh Prince intends to stand by and do nothing? It makes sense—your brother will never amount to anything, and your father’s career is ruined. The Shen family is now of no use to him. My daughter, you have no children and have lost favor. What will become of you in the future? If I had known this would happen, I would have married you off to an ordinary family for a peaceful life."

Mother and daughter, overwhelmed by sorrow, embraced each other and cried.

In the western courtyard, Xie Yurou had someone eavesdrop on their conversation. After dismissing the servant who reported back, she sneered, "Now that the Shen family has fallen, what future does Shen Qiaodan have? Hard times are just beginning for her—she should take her time and enjoy them."

Her maids were all extremely loyal, standing with lowered heads and blank expressions, pretending they had heard nothing.

At that moment, the Seventh Prince entered. Upon seeing the stunning beauty reclining on the couch, his usually indifferent gaze softened into a gentle smile.

"Ziqing, Madam Shen was here. Shouldn't you..." Xie Yurou maintained her usual gentle and kind demeanor, naturally inclined to plead for mercy.

"Say no more. Father is furious, and no one can persuade him. The Shen family must fend for themselves." The Seventh Prince’s expression turned cold for a brief moment. He understood the value of aiding others in times of crisis, but Shen Yibin was incompetent, and the only capable member of the Shen family, Shen Hui, had already lost his political future. The Shen family was simply not worth supporting.

Seeing his reaction, Xie Yurou said no more. She lifted her handkerchief to her lips, smiling discreetly.

After leaving the Seventh Prince’s residence, Madam Shen bought freshly roasted Eight-Treasure Duck from the Shi Jin Restaurant and took it to the imperial prison for her husband and son. The three of them sat together in silence.

"So, our family has officially been abandoned by the Seventh Prince?" After a long while, Shen’s father sighed deeply.

Madam Shen nodded, and tears streamed down her face again.

Zhou Yunsheng, having just finished a bowl of hot rice and a duck leg, finally spoke with satisfaction, "He now favors Concubine Xie and has cast my sister aside, even going as far as to reprimand her multiple times. It’s better that he’s abandoned us—at least we won’t end up helping him gain power only for Concubine Xie to reap all the benefits."

Lowering his voice, he whispered, "Father, why don’t we pledge allegiance to another master?"

Shen’s father trembled with rage, his beard quivering. He slammed his son’s head into the food box and roared, "Allegiance? We can’t even save our own lives, and you’re already thinking about this? Where do you get such bold ideas?!"

Zhou Yunsheng struggled free from his father’s grip, his face now covered in rice grains. He shouted towards the outside, "I confess! I am willing to confess! But I must see the Emperor first—if not, I’ll bash my head against the wall and die!"

Since the Emperor was eager to find the true author of the essay, he had been inquiring about it multiple times daily. However, Shen Yibin was stubborn, enduring severe beatings without revealing a word. The Deputy Minister of Justice was under immense pressure, so when he heard that Zhou Yunsheng was finally willing to confess, he immediately sent someone to inform the Emperor.

Gaining a brilliant minister in exchange for just one meeting, Emperor Tianchen readily agreed.

The father and son were brought before the Emperor and knelt down to pay their respects.

"Who is the person? Where does he live?" Emperor Tianchen asked impatiently.

"Your Majesty, that person is neither far away nor unknown—he is none other than myself," Zhou Yunsheng replied, his face still smudged with grains of rice, looking utterly disheveled.

The Emperor’s expression darkened instantly.

Zhou Yunsheng quickly added, "Your Majesty, I began speaking at eight months old, composing poetry at three, and have always been gifted with exceptional intelligence and a prodigious memory. I have read extensively and possess profound knowledge. That policy essay was indeed my own work—please, Your Majesty, see the truth!"

No one knew Shen Yibin’s capabilities better than his own father. Hearing his son boast so brazenly, Shen’s father wished he could rush over and shut his mouth. However, considering they were in the Qinzheng Hall, before the Emperor himself, he dared not act rashly.

The Emperor listened with amusement before throwing a copy of Huainanzi at him and commanding sternly, "You have one quarter of an hour to read this. Then, you must recite it word for word. If you make a single mistake, you will be executed immediately."

Shen’s father broke into a cold sweat, while Zhou Yunsheng respectfully replied, "Your Majesty, I do not need a quarter of an hour—just a few breaths will suffice."

With that, he picked up the book, flipped through it rapidly, then handed it to the chief eunuch before closing his eyes and reciting flawlessly.

The Emperor held the book, verifying his words. His expression shifted from cold to solemn, then from solemn to astonishment.

"Wait, start reciting from the third row on page 76." He ordered.

Zhou Yunsheng did not pause for even a moment and began reciting from the first word of the third row, without a single mistake.

"Recite from the sixth row on page 100."

Zhou Yunsheng continued without hesitation.

"Start from the third character of the seventh row on page 38."

Zhou Yunsheng nodded and followed the instruction exactly. His soul power was inherently strong, making "photographic memory" an understatement. Coupled with the super search engine 007, even if the Tianchen Emperor presented him with the most obscure books from the Great Zhou Dynasty, he could recite them fluently, forward and backward.

The Tianchen Emperor was utterly stunned, unable to speak for a long while. When he finally recovered, he worried that Zhou Yunsheng had memorized the book beforehand. To confirm his doubts, he ordered someone to fetch a newly compiled dictionary from the Hanlin Academy.

The dictionary had not yet been published; only the compilers and the Tianchen Emperor himself had seen it. It contained several million characters and was as thick as a brick.

"You have fifteen minutes. Recite this dictionary." This time, he did not throw the book but had his personal attendant hand it over. His tone was noticeably softer, showing that he was beginning to believe.

Shen's father remained kneeling, occasionally turning to look at his son, as if he no longer recognized him.

Zhou Yunsheng agreed without hesitation, flipping through the dictionary at the fastest speed. Under the emperor's examination, he recited it forwards, backwards, from the middle, and in fragments—displaying his photographic memory in every possible way.

The Tianchen Emperor was completely convinced. After a long silence, he finally spoke slowly, "Since you possess such extraordinary talent, why would you purchase the exam questions in advance? Was it not unnecessary trouble?"

Zhou Yunsheng showed a helpless expression. "Your Majesty, my humble servant's bookboy thought I would fail the exam and took it upon himself to buy the questions. I only learned of it afterward and thought, 'How could exam questions be purchased for just a few thousand taels of silver? Surely, it was a scam.' So I merely glanced at them before discarding them. Your humble servant was ignorant—please, Your Majesty, have mercy."

The Tianchen Emperor nodded thoughtfully. After a moment, he probed, "Your Two-Tax System is not flawless—are you aware of this?"

Zhou Yunsheng cupped his hands and replied, neither humble nor overbearing, "Your Majesty, I am aware. However, due to the length limitations of policy essays, I could not elaborate further in writing. The flaws of the Two-Tax System are as follows:

First, the long-term lack of adjustments to household classifications prevents the fair distribution of tax burdens based on wealth.

Second, the portion of the tax paid in currency exacerbates the shortage of circulating money, leading to inflation. People will be forced to sell silk, grain, and other goods at low prices to pay their taxes, increasing their financial burden.

Third, with legal land transactions, land annexation will become more rampant, and the wealthy…"

He listed the potential issues of the Two-Tax System one by one. Building on that, he proposed the more refined Single Whip Law and the Land Tax Reform. His vision was far-reaching, his reasoning meticulous, and his explanations exceptionally clear—so much so that the Tianchen Emperor was astounded and applauded in admiration.

"Someone, bring seats for Shen Gongzi and Shen Daren." The Tianchen Emperor personally stepped down from his throne to help them up, his face adorned with a warm smile. A true scholar always earned his respect—let alone a genius like Shen Yibin.

Zhou Yunsheng's backside was sore. As he sat down, he shook slightly, making the Tianchen Emperor feel even more guilty. The discussion then shifted from tax reform to land policies and military strategies. Zhou Yunsheng spoke concisely, his words sharp and thought-provoking. The Tianchen Emperor was utterly engrossed, wishing he could keep Zhou Yunsheng in the palace for a long, in-depth conversation.

Shen's father sat in a daze, holding his teacup, staring blankly at his son.

As the palace gates were about to close for the night, the Tianchen Emperor finally remembered that the father and son were still injured and hungry. He quickly summoned the imperial physician and had a meal prepared. After their wounds were treated and they had finished dining, the emperor personally escorted them to the palace gates and asked with a smile, "With such great talent, why has Yibin remained unknown until now?"

Zhou Yunsheng blushed slightly and cupped his hands. "Your Majesty, my father has high expectations for me. If he knew of my intelligence, he would confine me at home and not allow me to leave until I had read every book in Great Zhou. But I enjoy playing and cannot sit still, so I chose to hide my abilities."

Shen Yibin was only seventeen, and with the exceptional looks he inherited from his parents, his youthful face now bore a slight blush—making him look incredibly pure and endearing. Even the stray grain of rice stuck to his cheek did not diminish his charm in the slightest.

Emperor Tianchen carefully examined him for a moment, growing more and more fond of him. He personally picked off a grain of rice from his face and laughed heartily. "You call this hiding your talent? This is not just hiding some skill; this is hiding great skill."

Zhou Yunsheng looked embarrassed and quickly said, "Your Majesty, please don't laugh at me."

The father and son boarded the carriage and left the palace gates. Only then did Shen Father finally come to his senses. He raised his fist and gave his son a good beating. "I told you to hide your talent, I told you to hide your talent! If it weren’t for the fact that buying the real exam questions meant certain death, were you planning to hide it for a lifetime?"

Zhou Yunsheng dodged while joking, "Indeed, no one knows a son better than his father. I just don’t want to be an official. It’s too exhausting—having to attend court before dawn every day."

After finishing his beating, Shen Father let out a satisfied breath and laughed. "Even if you don’t want to, you have to! Do you think the Emperor will let you go? I thought our Shen family had reached a dead end, but who knew I’d have such a brilliant son? My dear son, did it hurt?"

Zhou Yunsheng shuddered at his father’s overly affectionate tone.



====================================================================================



Chapter 3.3
Not only did the Shen father and son return home safe and sound, but Shen Yibin also received an imperial decree from the Emperor. He was ordered to participate in the palace examination once the case was thoroughly investigated. If he failed to take the top scholar position, he should never consider entering officialdom again.

This showed just how high Emperor Tianchen’s expectations were for Shen Yibin. As long as he truly secured the top rank, his future rise to power and prominence would be inevitable.

Madam Shen circled around her son several times, beaming with joy. "I always knew my son was the smartest in the world. He’s been brilliant since childhood!"

Shen Father recalled his son's intelligence as a child and couldn’t help but sigh. He had once feared his son was a wasted talent like the prodigy Fang Zhongyong, but who would have thought the boy had been deliberately hiding his abilities all along? Every time he thought about it, he felt both exasperated and amused.

"Yibin, after some thought, I believe you’re right. The Seventh Prince is unrighteous, and your sister is unloved. It is time for us to change allegiance and serve a new master," Shen Father sighed as he stroked his beard.

"But if we stop supporting the Seventh Prince, wouldn’t Qiaodan suffer even more in the inner court?" Madam Shen’s eyes turned red with worry.

"Mother, you’ve misunderstood. As long as the Shen family remains strong, the Seventh Prince wouldn’t dare mistreat Sister. I’ve heard that he now favors his concubine, Lady Xie, above all others, treating the rest of his women as if they were invisible. If we continue supporting the Seventh Prince, the biggest beneficiary won’t be Sister—it will be Lady Xie, who enjoys his favor. Why should we toil for someone else's gain?" Zhou Yunsheng reassured his mother, gently patting her hand.

Madam Shen thought for a moment and found his words reasonable. Remembering how the Seventh Prince had refused to help, instead punishing and confining their daughter, she realized he had indeed been cruel to the Shen family. She said no more.

Due to the eunuch’s crime of stealing the examination questions, Emperor Tianchen carried out a major purge within the inner palace, eliminating spies planted by various factions. As a result, the Seventh Prince remained unaware that the extraordinary policy essay circulating among scholars had actually been penned by the so-called ignorant Shen Yibin.

Xie Yurou had been reborn and had deliberately befriended talented individuals who had been favored by the Seventh Prince in her past life. Among them was Lin Wenjie, a scholar renowned for ghostwriting essays for examination candidates.

Upon hearing that the Emperor possessed an exceptionally brilliant essay and was searching for its author, she subtly hinted to the Seventh Prince, claiming to have coincidentally met an extraordinary talent and suggesting he look into it.

Wanting to impress his father and recruit capable individuals, the Seventh Prince personally visited Lin Wenjie’s residence.

Lin Wenjie, a concubine-born son, had suffered under his stepmother’s oppression. He had initially planned to participate in the imperial examination, but his stepmother refused to find him a sponsor and even ordered servants to burn his academic documents, preventing him from entering the examination hall.

Living in hardship, he had been forced to write essays and poetry for money, gradually earning widespread fame. As the examination approached, more and more people came to him seeking essays, all focused on the same topic—the Land Tax System (租庸调). They repeatedly warned him not to publicize his work and never to write the same piece again in public. The payments ranged from thousands to tens of thousands of taels.

Being exceptionally intelligent, Lin Wenjie quickly realized the implications. He spent several days refining an outstanding essay and then sold it to multiple candidates. He did this deliberately, hoping to stir up a commotion and draw the Emperor’s attention to himself.

Thus, when the Seventh Prince arrived, Lin Wenjie was already dressed in his finest robes, prepared to welcome him with utmost respect.

The two discussed various academic topics, and the Seventh Prince, impressed by Lin Wenjie’s knowledge, explained his purpose for visiting. Lin Wenjie’s essay had already spread among the examiners and the court, but Zhou Yunsheng’s masterpiece had been carefully safeguarded by Emperor Tianchen. The Emperor had even instructed the examiners to keep it confidential to prevent any malicious schemes.

As a result, the Seventh Prince only knew about Lin Wenjie’s essay but was unaware that a far superior one existed.

After comparing their writings, Lin Wenjie feigned alarm and said, "So the essay on the Land Tax System was used in this context? This humble scholar was ignorant and deserves punishment!"

The Seventh Prince quickly helped him up, assuring him that the Emperor bore no grudge and was actually searching for the author to serve the court. Lin Wenjie was secretly overjoyed but pretended to decline a few times before agreeing to enter the palace with the prince.

Inside the Diligence Hall (勤政殿), Emperor Tianchen remained silent, scrutinizing Lin Wenjie with an inscrutable gaze. Only when Lin Wenjie began sweating profusely did the Emperor finally speak.

"Since you claim to have written that essay, can you recite it for me?"

Lin Wenjie steadied himself, bowed, and began reciting.

The Emperor’s stern expression turned to one of disdain, followed by a hint of disappointment. If not for Zhou Yunsheng’s work, the Emperor would have considered Lin Wenjie’s essay the best and would have been eager to recruit him. However, this man had rushed into the palace the moment he heard of an extraordinary essay in the examination, clearly revealing his opportunistic nature. Compared to the carefree, effortlessly brilliant Shen Yibin, he was utterly unremarkable.

"Enough. This essay is good but not remarkable enough to impress me," Emperor Tianchen stated coldly. "You are talented, but you are too eager for quick success."

He picked up the essay he had read countless times and handed it to his trusted attendant.

"Learning is meant for application; reading should begin with humility. Let him read this, so he knows why he lost."

Lin Wenjie sensed something was wrong. Trembling, he took the essay and read it carefully. Moments later, his face turned deathly pale.

"You should read it too, Old Seventh," the Emperor said with a wave of his sleeve.

The Seventh Prince complied and, after reading, was utterly shocked.

"Such an exquisite essay, filled with brilliant rhetoric and profound insights—may I ask, Father, which great scholar authored this masterpiece?" The Seventh Prince knelt respectfully.

"None other than your dear brother-in-law," Emperor Tianchen laughed heartily. "To buy himself more leisure time, he feigned ignorance before Shen Daren for over a decade. If he hadn't been pushed into a desperate situation, who knows how much longer he would have hidden his talents?"

The Seventh Prince’s heart pounded violently. He raised his head in astonishment, staring at the Emperor.

Emperor Tianchen could not be bothered to explain further and simply waved his hand. "I am weary. Leave now. When refining your literary skills, do not forget to cultivate your character. Always remember—there is always someone better than you."

Lin Wenjie was overwhelmed with shame. He bowed repeatedly before retreating with his face covered. The Seventh Prince had him escorted home but lost all interest in associating with him.

Sitting in his carriage, he carefully reflected on the essay.

Such a masterpiece, more splendid than the finest literary works of past dynasties, had actually come from Shen Yibin’s hand. He never would have believed it—if not for his father’s infallible judgment.

Realizing he had intended to ease his father’s burdens only to end up making a fool of himself, realizing the Emperor’s high regard for Shen Yibin, realizing how he had neglected Shen Qiaodan and abandoned the Shen family…

The Seventh Prince’s face flushed crimson, as if he had been slapped dozens of times. His cheeks burned with shame.

Shen Yibin was highly favored, and Shen Hui was one of the top officials in the Great Zhou. Losing the support of the Shen father and son was like losing his left and right arms. The Seventh Prince regretted it deeply and began to resent Xie Yuruo, who had misled him. After returning, he gave her a stern reprimanding.

He thought he had ruined Shen Hui's career, but unexpectedly, someone even more capable than Shen Hui, Shen Yibin, had emerged. Xie Yuruo carefully recalled Shen Yibin’s previous life and found that he had been a playboy with no visible talents at all.

Shen Yibin had always been fond of enjoying life. In his past life, with Shen Hui supporting him, he naturally lived a carefree life. But in this life, pushed to a dead-end, his true abilities were finally revealed. Did his own decisions cause this sudden change? Would there be even more unforeseen consequences in the future? Without the Shen family’s support, could the Seventh Prince still successfully ascend the throne?

Thinking about this, Xie Yuruo felt uneasy, secretly cursing her rash actions. She had effectively shot herself in the foot. However, she then remembered that she had already prepared a backup plan with the Crown Prince. No matter how much support the Seventh Prince had from officials, he would eventually bring about his own downfall. With that, she regained her composure.

The corruption case was finally resolved, and a large number of officials under the Crown Prince were dismissed. The Crown Prince himself was severely reprimanded by the Tianchen Emperor in front of all the court officials, losing all his face.

After a brief period of rest, the Tianchen Emperor issued an imperial decree to reopen the palace exam.

Zhou Yunsheng easily won the top scholar position and smoothly entered the palace exam. This time, the exam topic was still quite simple—only four characters: "Scholars, Farmers, Artisans, Merchants." The topic was vast, abstract in concept, and difficult to address, making many students frown and hesitate before they dared to write.

Zhou Yunsheng closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, his writing flowed like water, completing the essay in one stroke. "Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants are the foundation of the nation... Thus, a person does not hold office for others, and an official does not take over another's work. Scholars and farmers speak of strength, officials speak of conduct, artisans speak of skill, and merchants speak of numbers..."

He rejected the contemporary notion that "scholars are noble, and merchants are lowly" and fully elaborated on the contributions each group made to societal progress, especially the significant role of business development for the nation. His words were sharp and profound.

During the palace exam, most candidates wrote in a steady and cautious manner, aiming for harmony without offending the emperor. But Zhou Yunsheng, through his analysis, understood that the Tianchen Emperor’s tax reforms were actually aimed at lifting the sea ban to prepare for external trade. This essay not only didn’t touch a nerve, it struck the emperor’s interests.

Indeed, when the Tianchen Emperor approached him, he only glanced at two lines before pausing, and when he finished reading the entire essay, he couldn't help but clap and cheer.

All the scholars raised their heads, already knowing who the top scholar of the exam was.

As soon as the palace exam ended, the Tianchen Emperor eagerly summoned Zhou Yunsheng for a debate, and they continued discussing until it was dark before reluctantly letting him leave.

Three days later, the imperial decree came down, appointing Shen Yibin as the top scholar of the exam and granting him the position of an Assistant Scholar in the Hanlin Academy. He started his official career as a fifth-rank official, a close minister to the emperor, at only eighteen years old. If he trained well over the next few years, he would likely enter the cabinet and become a prime minister.

Now, Shen Yibin had become the most sought-after person in the capital. The suitors almost broke down the door of the Shen family.

Zhou Yunsheng used the excuse of "establishing a career before marriage" to reject all proposals. Shen’s father and mother, now eager to dote on him, naturally agreed with whatever he said.

Seventh Prince's Residence.

The Seventh Prince was reviewing the gift list that Shen Qiaodan had handed over and felt it was not enough, so he added another thirty percent. He said gently, "Once Yibin enters the Hanlin Academy, he will inevitably have to interact with others. As his elder sister, you should prepare more social gifts for him."

"Of course, I understand. I will go check the storeroom again." Shen Qiaodan replied with a smile, but her eyes no longer held any affection for the Seventh Prince. She had already realized that she had been given a sterilization drug, and she had long given up on vying for favor. As long as her family was powerful, her position in the household was unshakable. Instead of currying favor with the Seventh Prince, it was better to strengthen her relationship with her brother, who was her lifelong support.

As Shen Qiaodan came out of the main hall, she encountered the haggard-looking Xie Yuruo and couldn't help but sneer. "No matter how favored you are, so what? As long as the Shen family stands strong, you will never surpass me! All the schemes you’ve made in the past will one day be paid back to you!"
