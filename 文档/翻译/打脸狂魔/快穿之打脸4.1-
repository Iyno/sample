Chapter 4.1
Zhou Yunsheng had spent his entire life with Emperor Tianqi, yet they had never once quarreled. Before his death, Emperor Tianqi clutched his hand tightly, demanding that he be buried with him. The mad love in his eyes was deeply moving.

Without hesitation, Zhou Yunsheng agreed. When he caught sight of the dazzling light in the emperor’s eyes at that moment, he felt that he had made the right decision.

Back in the Star Sea Space, he stood amidst the stars, absorbing the power of that world. However, he soon realized that half of the energy within the vortex was being siphoned away, flowing toward an unknown destination beyond his perception.

How could this be? Could it be the Supreme God?

He frowned and quickly dismissed the thought. If the Supreme God had the ability to seize his power, he should have long discovered his existence and would have already attempted to eliminate him. Yet, there was no reaction at all, which meant it wasn’t the Supreme God.

Then who could it be?

A thought surfaced in his mind, but he didn’t dare dwell on it too deeply—he feared that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

After extracting the power, he fell into a deep sleep. When he woke up again, he was sitting in a bright classroom, surrounded by the sound of students reading aloud.

Glancing at the English textbook on his desk, he immediately found the section being read and followed along while simultaneously browsing through the information in his intellectual brain.

After traveling through countless worlds of harem and power-leveling plots, this time, he had finally entered a *world.

This body belonged to Lin Chengze. His parents had passed away, leaving him with several hundred thousand yuan in savings and an apartment. The original host could have used this money to study through university, find a job, and live a stable life. However, he was an extremely vain person with a severe materialistic mindset. When his parents were alive, he wore luxury brands and expensive watches. After their passing, without any restraints, his habits became even worse.

He squandered his savings in no time and had no choice but to resort to deceitful means.

Lin Chengze was gay and had a strong instinct for recognizing others of the same kind. He discovered that one of his classmates, the son of a wealthy family, was also gay and deliberately seduced him. That young master was naturally flirtatious and originally intended to toy with Lin Chengze before giving him some money and tossing him aside.

However, Lin Chengze was overheard chatting with a friend in the restroom, saying that he was only interested in the young master’s wealth, calling him stupid and rich.

The young master felt deeply insulted and was about to storm in to teach Lin Chengze a lesson, but his mischievous friend held him back, suggesting that instead of a simple beating, they should humiliate Lin Chengze thoroughly before discarding him.

The young master agreed and pretended that his family had gone bankrupt. He moved in with Lin Chengze and deliberately introduced him to his wealthy friends.

Lin Chengze, oblivious to the scheme, stepped right into the trap. Though he didn’t openly fall out with the young master, he began seducing his friends in secret. As a result, he was used by multiple people, and countless compromising photos were taken.

If it had ended there, it might not have been so bad. However, the young master genuinely fell in love with Lin Chengze’s closest friend, and Lin Chengze found out.

The young master then revealed everything, admitting that it was all a setup.

While Lin Chengze was devastated, those explicit photos were plastered all over the school walls. His friends abandoned him, and he lost his chance to take the college entrance exam. From then on, he could only survive by selling his body, ultimately contracting AIDS and dying.

After his death, his closest friend merely sighed, while the young master scoffed, saying he deserved it.

After reviewing Lin Chengze’s life, Zhou Yunsheng’s face darkened completely. He slowly turned to glance at the handsome young man sitting to his right.

This was the "poor" young master—Ji Hanyu, the protagonist gong of this world. The protagonist shou was Lin Chengze’s best friend, Fang Youran, who studied at a different school and had the personality of a "white lotus."

A green tea bitch and a white lotus—it was obvious who the protagonist gong would fall for.

At present, Ji Hanyu was pretending his family had gone bankrupt and had already moved into Lin Chengze’s home. Meanwhile, he was subtly developing feelings for Fang Youran, who was also staying at Lin’s house. At the same time, Lin Chengze, under Ji Hanyu’s influence, had set his sights on Ji Hanyu’s uncle, Cao Mokun, and was secretly trying to seduce him.

Of course, Ji Hanyu’s romance would end happily, while Lin Chengze would be treated as nothing by Cao Mokun. Lin Chengze repeatedly hinted at his feelings, but Cao Mokun never responded. Eventually, Lin Chengze turned to seducing others, leading to his downfall.

Understanding his situation, Zhou Yunsheng rubbed his face and continued looking at Lin Chengze’s regrets before his death.

The first regret: falling into Ji Hanyu’s trap, which led to his ruin.

The second regret: failing to take the college entrance exam.

The third regret: being forced into prostitution and unable to support himself independently.

Fortunately, the current Lin Chengze had only just begun pursuing Cao Mokun. Since Cao was a mature and steady adult, he merely warned his nephew not to be deceived. This meant there was still time to avoid the leaked photos incident.

As for the other two regrets, they were nothing for Zhou Yunsheng, who had an IQ of 180.

With that in mind, this world didn’t seem so bad after all.

Zhou Yunsheng picked up the English book and smiled mischievously. As a vengeful person, merely avoiding danger wasn’t his style—he was going to humiliate Ji Hanyu and make him realize that the world didn’t revolve around him.

“Chengze, let’s go.” As soon as the class bell rang, Ji Hanyu grabbed his backpack and kicked Zhou Yunsheng’s chair. He couldn’t wait to see Fang Youran.

“Alright, give me a second.” Zhou Yunsheng slowly packed his bag.

Ji Hanyu’s impatience was evident. He exchanged a quick glance with his friends by the classroom door—one full of malicious intent.

“Alright, let’s go.” Zhou Yunsheng pretended not to notice anything, slung his backpack over his shoulder, and walked out first.

Back home, Fang Youran was wearing a Winnie-the-Pooh apron, cooking in the kitchen. His delicate face was flushed red from the stove’s heat, making him look soft and adorable.

Ji Hanyu’s eyes lit up. He tossed his bag onto the sofa and hurried into the kitchen to help. The two stood close together, speaking in hushed tones, looking quite intimate.

The original Lin Chengze disliked the dirty kitchen and never stepped foot in it, so he was completely unaware of their growing bond.

Now, Zhou Yunsheng had no interest in the kitchen either. He simply took his bag and went straight to his room.

Fang Youran was an orphan—a gentle and virtuous housewife-like character. With his meticulous cleanliness contrasting Lin Chengze’s vanity and materialism, it was no surprise Ji Hanyu fell for him.

At this point, they had already shared their first kiss, though Ji Hanyu had forced it.

After checking his body in the mirror, Zhou Yunsheng couldn't deny that the original host's appearance was exceptionally beautiful—no wonder he later became a top escort.

Satisfied with his looks, he quickly showered and turned on the computer to play games. After decades in the Great Zhou dynasty, he had nearly forgotten what it felt like to use a keyboard.

Just as he was getting into the game, Fang Youran’s voice came from outside.

“Chengze, dinner’s ready.”

Zhou Yunsheng responded, but when he checked Lin Chengze’s bank balance before shutting down the computer, his face instantly turned green.

Only 200 yuan left.

No wonder Lin Chengze was so eager to find a new sugar daddy.

From this perspective, the ability to be self-sufficient must be prioritized. Although he could hack into a bank vault with just a few keystrokes, that wouldn't be self-sufficiency—it would be a crime. Lin Chengze had already gone down the wrong path once; he couldn't afford to make the same mistake again.

As a competent impersonator, he preferred to rely on the original skills of the person he was impersonating to make a living. Not only did this align with his aesthetic standards, but it also enhanced his survival ability. Any skill possessed by the villains he had played, he would diligently master until he could wield it even better than the original. Of course, in cases like Shen Yibin—who was utterly useless and driven to a dead end—he could only improvise.

What skills did Lin Chengze have? After thinking it over, it seemed that his only asset was his stunning appearance.

Zhou Yunsheng narrowed his eyes. In a world where looks mattered, that alone was more than enough.

While contemplating his future plans, he walked into the dining room and saw Ji Hanyu helping Fang Youran serve the dishes, repeatedly reminding him to be careful not to burn his hands.

"Let's eat." Zhou Yunsheng sat down, tapping his fingertips lightly on the table. A fleeting trace of authority escaped from him before he quickly concealed it.

Ji Hanyu and Fang Youran didn't notice, too busy serving food to each other.

"When are you going home? Your mother must be heartbroken. Aren't you going back to see her?" he asked casually.

"She doesn’t need me to. She already ran off with someone else." Ji Hanyu sneered. Fang Youran glanced at him with concern.

Zhou Yunsheng picked up a piece of tofu and continued, "Then what do you plan to do?"

Keep chasing my dear and messing with you while I’m at it, Ji Hanyu sneered internally. But on the surface, he looked troubled and sighed, "I plan to work while continuing my studies. Wang Jie recently suggested that we start a factory together, but I don’t have the capital."

"How much do you need? I can lend you some. I’ve saved up a bit from my part-time jobs," Fang Youran offered immediately.

Ji Hanyu smiled—not the kind that didn’t reach his eyes, but a genuine smile. "How could I take your money? It’s 300,000 yuan—selling you wouldn’t even get that much. You should use your money to buy yourself a few down jackets. It’s the middle of winter, and you’re just wearing two sweaters and a coat. Aren’t you cold?"

Fang Youran was naturally frugal and kind-hearted. The fact that he was willing to offer help without hesitation when Ji Hanyu was at his lowest touched him deeply. In contrast, Lin Chengze, who was only focused on eating and pretending not to hear anything, paled in comparison.



=====================================================================
Chapter 4.2
After dinner, Fang Youran went to the kitchen to wash the dishes, while Ji Hanyu lay on the sofa watching TV.

Zhou Yunsheng sat down beside him and asked in a low voice, “If you need money, why don’t you ask your uncle? The Cao family is rich.”

Ji Hanyu was clearly irritated by his constant talk about money, his expression turning impatient. “So what if they’re rich? That’s my uncle’s money, not mine. Besides, don’t you know? My mom may have the surname Cao, but she’s just an illegitimate child. When she was brought home, my grandmother was so furious she almost passed out. Do you really think my uncle would help us?”

“But he seems to care about you. Doesn’t he always take you out for meals?” Zhou Yunsheng pressed on.

“That’s not taking me out for meals—he just wants to enjoy watching me and my mom struggle. He’s the one who crushed the Ji family, without the slightest regard for our lives. If it weren’t for the fact that offending him would bring trouble, do you think I’d go? Alright, stop asking already, you’re annoying!” Ji Hanyu shot him a glare.

Zhou Yunsheng fell silent and returned to his room, locking the door behind him.

Although Ji Hanyu was technically Lin Chengze’s boyfriend now, Lin Chengze, understanding the value of playing hard to get, had never let him have his way. When Ji Hanyu first moved in, he did intend to get intimate, but after seeing Fang Youran at the Lin family’s place—stunning beyond belief—he voluntarily moved to sleep on the sofa.

For Zhou Yunsheng, this was an unfortunate situation, but at least not the worst outcome. Ji Hanyu, this rebellious teenager still stuck in his late-stage edgy phase, was definitely not his type.

His living expenses had dwindled to just 200 yuan. Right now, both Lin Chengze and Ji Hanyu were essentially living off Fang Youran, who supported them with his part-time job. As a villain, Zhou Yunsheng had inevitably picked up a taste for luxury and indulgence, and the inability to spend freely was downright unbearable for him.

“Alright, I need to find a job that brings in a lot of money, fast,” Zhou Yunsheng muttered as he opened his laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard, filtering through useful information.

Lin Chengze had neither a diploma nor experience, so getting a high-end job was out of the question. Fortunately, he had outstanding looks—perhaps he could even make a living off his appearance. As Zhou Yunsheng let his thoughts wander, he hacked into the official websites of several major entertainment companies, scanning for opportunities. Then, his fingers suddenly paused, and his gaze sharpened.

The rapidly flashing screen froze, displaying a casting announcement on the official website of AYA.

AYA was the world's largest luxury brand conglomerate, covering high-end brands in designer handbags, watches, custom couture, perfumes, luxury cars, and more.

Owning an AYA luxury item was a symbol of status and power. Every time the brand released a new product, it sent shockwaves through the entire fashion industry.

This time, AYA was launching a perfume line targeting the C-nation market, and they were looking for a model to star in the advertising campaign. The selection criteria were extremely unique:

The candidate must be stunningly beautiful—so breathtakingly attractive that they could captivate an entire nation, regardless of gender.
The candidate must be young, ideally between 15 and 18 years old.
The candidate must be at least 175 cm tall, with flawless skin—so delicate it looked like fine porcelain.
The candidate must have a unique aura—both pure and innocent yet seductive and mature.
These four requirements instantly eliminated 80-90% of the entertainment industry.

Zhou Yunsheng cross-checked each criterion, the corners of his lips slowly lifting into a smile.

Lin Chengze was a beauty—his features were exquisitely decadent, perfectly meeting the first requirement.
Lin Chengze was 17 years old—meeting the second requirement.
Lin Chengze stood at 176 cm. As for his skin, Zhou Yunsheng always adjusted his hosts' physical conditions to their peak upon arrival, so Lin Chengze was now flawless in every aspect—third requirement met.

As for the fourth requirement? Others might struggle with it, but for Zhou Yunsheng—an old monster who had reincarnated countless times—it was a mere trifle. Mature, seductive, pure, innocent, gentle, violent, wicked, righteous… there was no role he couldn’t play.

Since all the conditions were met, this was the one.

Zhou Yunsheng stroked his chin, contemplating how to get into the audition.

He hacked into an entertainment company’s database, using his top-tier hacking skills to fabricate an artist profile for himself, linking it to a certain manager’s roster. Since he still had to take the college entrance exam in June, he set his contract to expire in April. Then, he hacked into AYA’s official website and inserted his name into the list of candidates.

After finishing everything, he picked up his phone and contacted his newly assigned manager.

"Hello, this is Yu Meilian. Who’s this?" A sharp, no-nonsense female voice came through, accompanied by the sound of a cigarette being lit.

"Hello, Sister Yu. I’m Lin Chengze, originally an artist under your management. Sorry for not contacting you sooner."

Lin Chengze’s voice was clear and melodious, so pleasant that it put people at ease instantly.

Yu Meilian’s tightly furrowed brows relaxed slightly. She ran through the list of artists under her care—who the hell was Lin Chengze? A few months ago, after a certain manager died in a car accident, she and a few others split up his most promising artists. Since she had no recollection of this name, he was probably just another nobody.

With that in mind, Yu Meilian lost interest. A pleasant voice meant nothing—what mattered in this industry was looks.

She was about to brush him off and hang up when the next words out of his mouth nearly made her drop her cigarette.

"Sister Yu, I’ve been selected by AYA for an audition tomorrow. Could you come pick me up?"

"Wait, wait, wait—did you just say AYA?!" Yu Meilian nearly jumped to her feet, her cigarette slipping from her fingers and almost burning a hole in her skirt. She frantically patted at it while hurriedly confirming, "Are you absolutely sure?"

AYA was the pinnacle of luxury brands, and every single one of its brand ambassadors was a globally influential superstar. The opportunity to audition for them was a golden ticket that every entertainment company was desperately fighting for.

Yu Meilian had already exhausted every connection she had to secure an audition for one of her artists, only to be cut from the list at the last minute. Meanwhile, her biggest rival had managed to grab a spot.

Yumeilian was still feeling frustrated when, out of nowhere, a golden opportunity fell right into her lap.

Clutching her phone tightly, she asked in a low voice, “How did you get this slot? Who brought you in?”

“No one brought me in. I was just walking down the street when I ran into a foreigner named Bonnie. He handed me a business card and told me to attend the AYA interview. I didn’t believe it at first, but then I saw AYA’s list of candidates and decided to call you.”

Zhou Yunsheng’s voice carried a hint of nervousness, but his expression remained lazy and carefree. He absentmindedly twirled a strand of hair by his temple.

“Hold on, let me check,” Yumeilian suppressed the pounding of her heart and opened AYA’s official website. Sure enough, she saw Lin Chengze’s name on the list. Her heart skipped a beat. She quickly logged into the company’s internal system and pulled up the artist database.

The moment Lin Chengze’s breathtakingly gorgeous face popped up on the screen, she was stunned.

Damn it, how did she ever miss out on such a gem? Was she blind or what?

Luckily, the artists that got passed over were randomly assigned to different managers, and he just so happened to fall under her name. When luck comes knocking, there’s no stopping it!

If Lin Chengze doesn’t become famous, it would be an absolute crime against the heavens for wasting that face!

Yumeilian took several deep breaths to steady her voice. “Alright, I see it. You’re on the list. Where do you live? I’ll pick you up tomorrow at 8:30.”

Zhou Yunsheng gave her an address, then hung up the phone, rolled himself up in his blanket, and went to sleep in peace.

The next morning, Zhou Yunsheng ate breakfast while instructing Ji Hanyu, “I won’t be going to class for a while. Help me apply for leave.”

Ji Hanyu didn’t ask why, just gave a nod.

Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him and spoke gently, “Don’t worry. Even though the Ji family has gone bankrupt, we’ll find a way. There’s always a way out.”

Ji Hanyu didn’t even spare him a proper look and simply let out a perfunctory “mm.” Inside, however, he sneered at Lin Chengze’s act. He knew the guy despised him to the core, yet still refused to cut ties completely—wasn’t it just because he wanted to use his connections with the rich second-generation kids?

Go ahead, step onto that bridge. If you dare, I’ll make sure you fall so hard you shatter into pieces!

Fang Youran, still distracted from being forcibly kissed by Ji Hanyu the night before, avoided eye contact with Lin Chengze and refrained from asking questions.

After breakfast, the two left together. Zhou Yunsheng returned to his room and changed into a white shirt and light blue jeans. Just as he was about to slip his phone into his pocket, it rang—it was Yumeilian.

“I’m here. Come downstairs. Black Audi, license plate number xxxxx.”

Zhou Yunsheng responded with a simple “okay” and casually took the elevator down.

The moment he got into the car, Yumeilian gave him a once-over, her eyes gleaming with the delight of having struck gold.

“Hold out your hand, let me feel it. If your skin isn’t up to standard, you might as well not bother going.” She openly took advantage of the moment, marveling at the smoothness beneath her fingertips.

“Bonnie touched it too. At the time, I thought he was a pervert,” Zhou Yunsheng’s cheeks flushed slightly, making his already stunning features even more mesmerizing.

Yumeilian burst into laughter and asked while driving, “What grade are you in?”

“Senior year. College entrance exams are in June.”

“So what are your plans? Your parents have passed away—you need a job to support yourself, right? I checked your contract. It expires at the end of April. The heavens have blessed you with this face, and if you don’t use it to make a living, it’s a total waste. If you sign a new contract with me, I guarantee I’ll turn you into an international superstar. Look at yourself—you have no degree, no work experience, and you’re still young. No other company would hire you, and even if they did, the pay would be terrible…”

She spared no effort in persuading him, afraid that this precious find might slip away.

“Let’s talk after I shoot this commercial. My parents always wanted me to get into a prestigious university. I need to fulfill their wish,” Zhou Yunsheng deliberately let a trace of sorrow show.

Yumeilian fell silent for a moment before teasing, “Oh? So you think you’re definitely getting the part, huh?”

Zhou Yunsheng cast her a sidelong glance, the corners of his lips lifting slightly.

The sheer confidence in his gaze and expression was so electrifying that Yumeilian could hardly handle it. She quickly turned her eyes back to the road, but deep down, she was grinning from ear to ear.




============================================================


Chapter 4.3
The two arrived at Aya’s branch in Country C. After verifying their names on the list, the receptionist led them to the meeting room on the 19th floor.

“Yu Meilian, why are you here? Didn’t Annie get eliminated?” a man pacing in the hallway asked in surprise.

“Annie was eliminated, but Chengze was chosen instead. Come, Chengze, meet Brother Wu Tao. He’s one of our company’s top talent agents.” Yu Meilian waved him over.

Wu Tao was still wondering who Chengze was when a slender and elegant young man stepped forward from behind Yu Meilian. His slightly curved eyes shimmered with a captivating brilliance, and his rosy lips curled into an alluring smile. The moment he appeared, everyone waiting in the hallway was instantly overshadowed. Silently, they all sized him up, each reaching the same conclusion—without a doubt, Aya’s selection process seemed tailor-made for him.

“What’s his full name? Where did you find him?” Wu Tao tried to maintain his composure but couldn’t help scanning his own artists. He had initially thought they were of exceptional quality, but now, none of them seemed up to par. It was a classic case of comparison making everything else look inferior.

“He was transferred under my management,” Yu Meilian said as she found a seat for the young man before turning back to Wu Tao with a smug smile.

“Impossible! How could I have missed someone like him?” Wu Tao’s face darkened. As the most senior agent, he had taken the most promising candidates first, leaving the rest for people like Yu Meilian.

“I think he was someone’s trump card, so his profile was hidden. The leftover candidates were all registered in the company’s system, which meant he was randomly assigned to me. He’s got some incredible luck, too—just walking down the street, he caught the eye of Aya’s senior executives and was recommended for an audition.” Yu Meilian covered her mouth with a delighted chuckle, thoroughly enjoying the way Wu Tao’s expression shifted from pale to livid.

While the two agents exchanged veiled barbs, Zhou Yunsheng calmly put on his headphones and listened to music.

Wu Tao’s artist, Bao’er, was a member of a popular idol group. She had an exceptionally delicate appearance, making her very popular. Upon entering, she had looked around with confidence, feeling that no one in the room was more outstanding than her. However, after seeing Lin Chengze, her self-assurance crumbled instantly. She quickly moved several seats away, afraid of being completely outshone if she sat too close to him.

One by one, the candidates entered the meeting room—only to be immediately sent out again.

Aya’s chief designer, who was also the perfumer behind this fragrance, Orlando, waved his hand dismissively with a look of disdain.

“Your skin isn’t smooth or delicate enough. Out!”

“You dare come here looking like that? Confidence is good, but being overconfident is a problem. Out!”

“How old are you? Fifteen? You look at least thirty-five! Your eye bags are practically hanging down to your nose. Out!”

“I did say I wanted someone with both mature charm and youthful innocence, but what is this? Is she an artist or a—ugh, vulgar! Absolutely unbearable! Out, out, out!”

After rejecting dozens of candidates, Orlando massaged his forehead, feeling on the verge of a breakdown.

The staff handling the audition process were also close to losing their minds. Mature charm combined with youthful innocence—what the hell does that even mean? If their understanding of the language wasn’t completely off, those were two completely contradictory traits! But somehow, someone in the past had managed to embody both, hadn’t they? They had been stunning! Had Orlando’s aesthetic standards already transcended human limits?

Oblivious to their silent complaints, Orlando continued dismissing candidates with just a glance.

Finally, it was Bao’er’s turn. Orlando’s eyes flickered with interest as he beckoned her over.

Bao’er was secretly delighted. She walked forward in small, graceful steps.

Orlando gently touched the back of her hand, his expression softening slightly. Then, he held her chin and examined her face from different angles. After a few minutes, he nodded.

“Not bad. Go ahead and audition.”

Bao’er glanced around the empty meeting room, where only a single potted rose sat in the center. “How do I audition? Is there a theme?”

For once, Orlando showed some patience. Folding his arms, he replied, “No theme. Just walk over and smell the flowers.”

Smell the flowers? Oh, right—this was a perfume advertisement, so it made sense to showcase the uniqueness of the scent. When smelling it, she needed to appear intoxicated by the fragrance while displaying her most beautiful expression, embodying the concept of being as captivating as a flower.

Feeling inspired, Bao’er acted like an innocent young girl frolicking through a breathtaking garden. Suddenly, she was drawn to an especially vibrant cluster of roses, her face lighting up in awe. She approached slowly, her steps light and graceful, as if afraid of startling the butterflies resting on the petals. Finally, she reached the flowers, bent down, and lowered her head, closing her eyes as if in deep intoxication. Her flawless profile blended beautifully with the fiery red roses.

The staff exchanged approving smiles and then sneaked a glance at Orlando.

“Out! What a waste of my time!” Orlando snapped, utterly exasperated.

Bao’er jumped in shock, her large, almond-shaped eyes brimming with disbelief and hurt.

“Did you not hear me? I said out! Get out!” Orlando showed no mercy, rolling up the audition list into a paper tube and smacking it against the table. His eyes practically shot fire.

Boa ran out, covering her face, utterly humiliated.

The director in charge of filming the commercial couldn't bear to watch any longer and advised, "Orlando, that young girl just now was actually quite good. She fully conveyed the feeling you were looking for. I've reviewed her profile—she has the best appearance among all the candidates. If even she gets turned away, I’m afraid this commercial won't be completed."

"If it can't be completed, then we’ll change the theme. I'd rather not have a model in this commercial at all than settle for mediocrity. This perfume is called Mí. In your country’s ancient language, mí and mí (糜) share the same meaning—beauty. Beauty so extravagant, so extreme, that it borders on decay. Only flowers that bloom to the verge of rotting can release the most intoxicating and intense fragrance. I need a beauty like that—so stunning, so decadent, yet still brimming with vitality like a budding flower. Only such a beauty is worthy of my perfume. Understand?"

The director and the crew nodded repeatedly, awed by Orlando’s proficiency in their language. They all had the same unspoken thought: Are you sure you’re describing a person and not some kind of fairy? Wouldn’t it be faster to have a VFX company create a 3D animated version of this ad instead?

Orlando composed himself and called out loudly, "Next!"

Zhou Yunsheng snapped out of his daze as Yu Meilian nudged him forward. Removing his headphones, he slowly walked in.

"Hello, I am Lin Chengze, an artist under Huayu Company. I'm 17 years old, 176 cm tall, and weigh 53 kg—"

Before he could finish his introduction, Orlando eagerly beckoned him over. "Come here, quickly! My God, I’ve finally found you!"

Zhou Yunsheng approached, his peach blossom eyes sparkling with a lively gleam.

Orlando had intended to grasp his chin, but the moment his fingertips brushed against the boy’s delicate, porcelain-like skin, he hesitated. Instead, he carefully stroked and pinched it, his eyes scrutinizing the young man from head to toe like a searchlight.

"Your appearance is excellent. Go ahead and audition," he instructed, pointing at the roses.

The director and crew had to admit—the teenager's looks far surpassed Boa’s, even putting Zhang Yijia, widely regarded as the most beautiful woman in the country, to shame. Given a few more years for his features to fully mature, who knew what kind of otherworldly beauty he would become?

"Do I need to smell the flowers?" Zhou Yunsheng had already hacked into AYA’s surveillance system through his AI and had seen Boa's entire audition. He had also heard Orlando’s interpretation of the perfume.

Mí— a word dripping with sensuality.

Lost in thought, Zhou Yunsheng approached the roses.

His gait was elegant, carrying a touch of leisure and indifference, as if the entire garden of flowers and greenery was beneath his notice. Stopping before the roses, his eyes narrowed slightly as his pale fingers gently played with the petals, as if he cherished them. Yet the cold detachment in his gaze told a different story.

He seemed disinterested, ready to leave, when a thorn on the stem pricked his fingertip. A droplet of crimson blood slowly seeped out. He stared at it, intrigued, a flicker of amusement finally surfacing in his dark eyes—only to be immediately concealed. With a single motion, his fingers clenched, crushing the fiery-red rose into fragments.

The flower’s deep-red juice oozed between his fingers. His smile grew, a dark delight gleaming in his eyes. Raising his hand to his nose, he inhaled deeply. His expression was one of intoxicated pleasure, tinged with a manic obsession. A few drops of flower juice inevitably stained his cheek. He licked them away with the tip of his pink tongue, his peach blossom eyes misting over with an ambiguous, sultry sheen…

The boy’s face still bore traces of youthful innocence, yet every movement radiated an irresistible allure. It was an explosive beauty—an extravagant, decadent beauty, one so intense that its sweetness could be smelled from afar.

Orlando swallowed with difficulty, while the rest of the crew had long since fallen into a trance. Their faces flushed, their expressions dazed.

"Let me see… Lin Chengze, an artist from Huayu Company. Alright, it's him. Come back in three days for the commercial shoot. Make sure to take good care of your skin." Orlando made the decision on the spot, then turned away, pressing a hand to his wildly beating heart.

Lin Chengze smiled and nodded. Walking over to the trash bin, he discarded the flower petals, then pulled out a handkerchief and meticulously wiped off the flower juice.

A searing gaze lingered on him. He frowned slightly and looked toward the doorway.

No one was there.

Cao Mokun was taking the elevator to the top floor. AYA was a subsidiary of the Cao Corporation, and he had dropped by today on a whim.

"That person looked familiar," he remarked lazily, his voice relaxed. Yet the prominent bulge in his pants completely betrayed the turmoil within him.

"He’s Young Master Ji’s classmate, Lin Chengze. We've had meals with him a few times," his assistant reminded him.

Cao Mokun thought for a moment before his tone turned slightly surprised. "That kid who tried to seduce me? Are you sure?" He simply couldn’t connect the vulgar, unimpressive youth from before with the mesmerizing, demonic figure he had just seen.

"Yes," the assistant confirmed after a moment of hesitation.

Cao Mokun chuckled playfully. "If he tries to seduce me again, I might as well go along with it."

The assistant silently mourned for his boss’s integrity. "Boss, he’s Young Master Ji’s boyfriend. If Ji finds out, it might affect your relationship as uncle and nephew."

"Someone like him? Ji Hanyu will never be able to keep him. Sooner or later, he’ll fly away. Besides, I’m just playing—I won’t make them break up. Once I’ve had my fun, I’ll give him some hush money, and Ji Hanyu will never know." Cao Mokun waved dismissively, utterly unconcerned.


=======================================================

Chapter 4.4

The door of the reception hall opened. Yu Meilian eagerly rushed forward, while Wu Tao and Bao’er remained nearby, waiting at a distance.

“How did it go?”

“It’s done. I’ll come over to shoot the commercial in three days. Sister Yu, help me negotiate a good price. I need the money urgently.” As Zhou Yunsheng spoke, he folded the handkerchief stained with flower juice into a neat square and stuffed it into his pocket.

“Don’t worry. Even though you’re a newcomer, AYA is wealthy. The payment will definitely be substantial,” Yu Meilian assured confidently.

Zhou Yunsheng patted her shoulder. “I’ll be counting on you, then. I still have classes, so I’ll get going.” As he passed by Wu Tao, whose expression was complicated, and Bao’er, whose eyes were red, he gave a slight nod and pulled out a dazzling smile.

Three days passed quickly. During this time, Yu Meilian called to inform him that AYA had offered a payment of 500,000 yuan for the commercial. For a newcomer, this was already an astronomical sum, so she had taken the liberty of accepting the deal.

For most newcomers, shooting a commercial typically earned them at most a few hundred thousand yuan, with some receiving only tens of thousands. Only true top-tier stars could command millions for a single ad. Zhou Yunsheng was well aware of industry standards, so he sincerely thanked Yu Meilian for her efforts.

That day, he woke up early. As he buttoned up his shirt, he opened the door and walked toward the dining room.

The teenager’s skin was as smooth and fair as milk, glowing faintly under the warm orange light. His hair was uncombed, casually tousled with his fingers, appearing messy yet alluring. His peach blossom eyes, still hazy with sleep, were misty with a thin layer of moisture, making him look innocent and adorable.

Though he seemed slender, his body was far from fragile. His half-buttoned shirt partially revealed a taut, flexible waist and a set of well-defined abdominal muscles. Higher up, his delicate and elegant collarbones were exposed.

He yawned, his peach blossom eyes welling with two teardrops. Instead of rolling down his cheeks, they clung to his thick eyelashes. He sat down at the dining table, resting his right cheek in his palm while lazily stirring his hot porridge with a spoon in his left hand. The rising steam blurred his features, making his relaxed demeanor all the more captivating.

A loud crash abruptly shattered the tranquility. He frowned and looked across the table, only to see Ji Hanyu, his face flushed red, jumping up to avoid the porridge spilling all over the table.

“Stay still, I’ll clean it up. You’re a grown man, yet you still manage to knock over a bowl. What were you thinking just now?” Fang Youran rushed out from the kitchen with a cloth.

“I... I was just thinking about my family.” Ji Hanyu stammered, quickly glancing at Lin Chengze, who was calmly drinking his porridge. No matter how much he disliked Lin Chengze, he had to admit that the man’s looks were flawless. It had only been a few days, yet his features seemed even more refined. His every move was no longer the frivolous and carefree demeanor of the past but carried a touch of elegant laziness—like a Persian cat basking in the sunlight, making Ji Hanyu itch with the urge to reach out and stroke him.

Fang Youran felt a pang of sadness but silently picked up the broken porcelain, wiped away the spilled porridge, and refilled a new bowl for him. His tone was gentle. “Don’t dwell on things at home. You’re in your senior year now—your studies should come first.”

Ji Hanyu nodded. Seeing that Lin Chengze, sitting across from him, didn’t even offer a word of comfort, his fleeting admiration vanished instantly, replaced by disdain and anger.

Lin Chengze lowered his gaze indifferently, unconcerned about the ambiguous interactions between the main protagonist and the love interest. He continued drinking his porridge and slowly said, “Help me take a few days off. I have something to do.”

“What are you up to again? Where are you going? Don’t forget that the college entrance exam is coming up next June,” Ji Hanyu uncharacteristically pressed for details.

“I said I have something to do. Don’t ask so many questions.” Lin Chengze tossed his spoon aside, wiped his mouth, and, seeing his phone ring, picked up the call and walked out the door.

Ji Hanyu went to the window and looked down, seeing him get into an Audi Q7. He sneered coldly—a slut is still a slut. The more beautiful they are, the more shameless they become. His gaze shifted back to Fang Youran, who was cleaning up the table, and the twisted thoughts in his mind quickly settled.

Zhou Yunsheng and Yu Meilian arrived at AYA’s branch office, where the staff had already set up the studio. The lights and cameras were in place, waiting for the shoot to begin.

“Mr. Orlando, did you forget to give us the script?” Yu Meilian stopped the blonde foreigner, who was darting around.

“Oh, my little fairy is finally here! Quick, quick, go change.” Orlando completely ignored Yu Meilian, his eyes filled only with the smiling teenager standing under the lights.

Little fairy, my ass! Zhou Yunsheng cursed inwardly, but his face remained bright with a dazzling smile. He nodded slightly before following the stylist backstage.

Yu Meilian forcefully tugged at the already-drunk Orlando and politely asked again, “Mr. Orlando, you forgot the script. How are we supposed to shoot without one?”

“Oh, I forgot to tell you—there’s no script for this commercial. Just start filming once the little fairy is ready.” He twirled his fingers delicately, smoothing down his messy hair. Spotting a tall figure walking in through the door, he immediately scurried over excitedly.

Yu Meilian also turned to look, and her already tense nerves nearly snapped. Holy shit, that’s Cao Mukun!

Cao Mukun, the ruthless predator of the business world. The great white shark of commerce. The man who could crush an elite family with just a flick of his finger! What was he doing here?

Right—this man had a well-known fondness for beauty, regardless of gender. If he took a liking to Lin Chengze, what should they do?

Yu Meilian turned away, her expression darkening. As an agent, she had been forced into some shady dealings before. It wasn’t by choice—it was just how the industry worked. Nowadays, to make it big, one had to pay unimaginable prices. But Lin Chengze was still underage, an orphan at that. She truly couldn’t bring herself to push him into such a situation.

At this moment, she didn’t even consider the possibility that Cao Mukun might not be interested in Lin Chengze. What a joke! With Lin Chengze’s looks, anyone who didn’t fall for him must be blind.

Zhou Yunsheng didn't know that Yu Meilian had fallen into an unprecedented tangle as he was struggling to pull the zipper of his jeans.

"Will it be too tight?It's a little difficult for me to walk."He took a deep breath and deflated his stomach.

"Not too tight, just right."The stylist's eyes flicked back and forth between the teenager's abs, mermaid line, firm buttocks, and slender legs, unable to pull them off, and he sucked in his saliva as soon as the words left his mouth.

The corner of Zhou Yunsheng's mouth twitched and asked, "Where are the clothes?"

"There are no clothes, the upper half of the body is naked like this."

"What about shoes?"Zhou Yunsheng shook his bare feet.

"No shoes either."The stylist painstakingly moved his eyes away and shoved him out the door, "Alright, it's almost time, time to go out.Orlando has a foul temper and will curse if he waits too long."

"OHMYGOD! Baby, you're like a piece of melting cheese baked hot and sprinkled with frosting sugar, I just want to taste you!"Orlando yelled with a drooling look on his face.

All the staff members looked over with burning eyes, which were mixed with a bunch of sharp and piercing lines of sight.

Zhou Yunsheng followed the line of sight and his eyes flashed slightly.Beside the director stood a very tall man, at least 190 centimeters by eye estimation, a well-fitting and expensive suit wrapped around a strong physique, his hair was completely combed to the back of his head, revealing a knife-sharpened and axe-chiseled handsome face, his narrow eyes were slightly narrowed, and his beautiful thin lips were slightly raised, with a playful expression of evil.

Cao Merkun?

Tuning out the man's identity from the original owner's memory, Zhou Yunsheng indifferently retracted his gaze and looked at Orlando, "May I ask how I should shoot?Sister Yu said that you guys never gave her a script."

"Ah, there's no script, we'll just shoot you, any angle, any movement, any expression of you, and then edit out all the most beautiful and sexy images to synthesize the most living and breathing advertisement.Baby, you just have to play freely, go ahead."In one swift motion, Orlando pushed the teenager into the studio covered with various flower petals.

Zhou Yunsheng looked at the thick layer of flower petals that he stepped on under his feet and was quite speechless.Entertainers were indeed a profession that purely sold their sex.

Cao Merkun had thought that the teenager would shyly come up to curry favor as usual, but he didn't expect that he would just take a quick glance and move away as if he didn't recognize himself.

To capture?Cao Merkun pondered, took out a cigar from his pocket, cut it open and lit it, and took a hard drag.

Zhou Yunsheng walked around the petals a few times and waved at Orlando, "Can you give me a bottle of red wine?I want to borrow alcohol to find some feelings."

"Beauty, red wine, flowers, perfume er ...... this combination is awesome!"Orlando clapped his hands, his face full of intoxication, and his assistant rushed over with a bottle of red wine.

Zhou Yunsheng tilted his head and poured a large mouthful, felt that it was not enough and poured a few more mouthfuls, the bright red liquid slid down his delicate jaw to the long and beautiful neck, then the sexy collarbone, flat white chest ...... He put down the bottle of wine, his cheeks flushed with red, his peach blossom eyes were hazy and rippled with light, and his slightly drunken state was tantalizing to the extreme.

The studio resounded with the sound of gulping here and there.

Orlando took the bottle and waved his hand, "Finding your groove, are you?Start shooting when you find it."As he turned his back, he aimed an indirect kiss at the mouth of the bottle.

Cao Merkun coldly grunted when he saw this scene, his face a bit ugly.

His assistant coughed and reminded, "Boss, you'd better find a seat to sit down and watch, while everyone is paying attention to Lin Chengze."Otherwise, when everyone returns to their senses, you should make a fool of yourself!

He didn't dare to say the last sentence, and only stared at the boss's high crotch with his eyes.

Cao Merkun didn't feel embarrassed at all, walking施然 to the director's side and asking for a soft chair to sit down, his sharp eyes firmly locked on the teenager.

Zhou Yunsheng was already a little drunk, his eyes were in a trance and he smiled at the camera, then lay down in the petals and yawned lazily.He had a good taste in alcohol, and once he was drunk, sleepiness came to his head.

Seems to feel the body a little cold, he will petals gathered to the chest, would like to close his eyes to take a nap, realizing that is now filming commercials, and reluctantly opened, turned sideways to face the camera, resting on his cheeks and again a haze of a smile, watery misty eyes are intoxicating.

"Good, these two smiles are great, must not be cut!"Orlando's face reddened with excitement.

==========================================================

Chapter 4.5

Zhou Yunsheng paid no attention to Orlando's antics. Seeing a mist with a strong fragrance floating down from the air, he reached out to catch it, held it in his palm, lowered his head, and sniffed it. He seemed to like it very much, and then smiled lazily. He grabbed a handful of petals, crushed them, opened his mouth, stuck out his tongue, and licked the bright red flower juice flowing from his fingers.

After getting drunk, he always felt thirsty easily.

The elf-like, extravagant young man fell into the fragrant mist, his body covered with fresh red flower juice and scattered petals. The scene was beautiful, yet it exuded a sweet, sticky smell, enticing and hypnotizing, luring one to fall.

The cameraman was sweating profusely, his face flushed, nearly unable to resist the visual shock the boy gave him, but he had no choice but to continue filming.

The director forgot to shout "cut," the crew forgot to move, and they all stared blankly at the boy. Only Orlando kept muttering, "This shot can't be cut, that one can't either. Ah, the shot of him licking the flower juice, let's shoot a close-up later. Also, we need close-ups of his face, eyes, and feet. The round, pink toes are so cute!"

"Orlando, shut up!" Cao Moken snuffed out his cigar and spoke in a rough, hoarse voice, unable to bear it anymore.

Orlando immediately made a zipping motion with his lips.

Zhou Yunsheng rolled around in the petals for several rounds, almost dizzy, when he finally heard the director shout "cut." "Take a break, we'll shoot a few close-ups later."

He breathed a sigh of relief, tousled his hair, and walked toward Yu Meilian, who was red-faced with shining eyes.

"Lin Chengze." A deep, hoarse voice came from behind.

"Uncle Cao." Zhou Yunsheng respectfully nodded at the person.

Cao Moken clearly didn't expect him to address him this way. His smile froze for a moment, but he didn’t say anything. Instead, he used his thumb to rub the flower juice on the boy's lips and walked away casually.

His assistant looked at Yu Meilian and reminded her, "After the shoot, there's a dinner. Please make sure you attend. I'll go ahead, see you later."

Yu Meilian nodded with a pale face. Standing on someone else's turf and holding someone else's pay, she had no choice but to attend this dinner.

"Xiaoze, be careful later, don't drink too much."

"I know, Sister Yu, I'll be fine." Zhou Yunsheng wasn't worried. He knew that stepping into the entertainment industry meant encountering such things, but he had enough self-preservation ability, so he wasn’t concerned.

"If you really can't resist, you might as well try to enjoy it. You've heard of Cao Moken, right? The big shark that eats people without spitting out bones. But if you go along with him, the benefits are obvious. He can make you famous in the shortest time. Zhang Yijia followed him for less than a month, and now she's super popular. I'm not encouraging you to jump into the fire, it's just the way things are. If you follow him, it will only be uncomfortable for a few months. If you don't, you'll be uncomfortable for life." Yu Meilian's face showed some hesitation.

Zhou Yunsheng nodded repeatedly, listening but not taking it to heart.

After shooting a few close-ups, the fiery shoot finally ended. The cameraman quickly took out a napkin to wipe the sweat off his face, his eyes shifting, unable to look directly at the boy. He was sure that once the advertisement aired, everyone would be mesmerized by the feast of beauty.

The film had no shots related to perfume, but you could still smell that irresistible fragrance. He had to admit that Orlando's aesthetic taste truly surpassed human limits.

Zhou Yunsheng took a shower, changed into the white shirt and down jacket he had come in, and walked with Yu Meilian to the elevator. Just as they reached the door, they saw Cao Moken’s stoic-faced assistant already waiting there.

The assistant led them to a top-tier club, where Cao Moken and several high-profile men were already seated around a dining table, accompanied by a few popular celebrities.

"Baby, you're here." Cao Moken stretched out his long arms and pulled the boy to sit beside him.

Zhou Yunsheng stared at him with his alluring peach blossom eyes, as if asking, "When did I become your baby?"

Cao Moken adored the boy's expressive eyes. He gently brushed his curled lashes with his thumb, then pointed at the men, introducing them one by one. Some were executives from Aya, some were partners of the Cao family consortium, and a few were CEOs of the top production companies in the country.

Yu Meilian nervously pulled Zhou Yunsheng over to greet everyone, completely forgetting her previous hesitation. No wonder Zhang Yijia became famous so quickly; it was all thanks to these wealthy benefactors. Anyone here could easily be a giant in the business world, and usually, it would be impossible to even get a connection.

Zhou Yunsheng knew his life wasn't yet on track and that he couldn't afford to fall out with Cao Moken, so he quietly endured. After greeting everyone, he drank a glass of wine to show respect.

Cao Moken was very satisfied with his obedience. He pulled him into his arms, kissed his forehead, and then placed a bowl of nourishing soup in front of him, speaking gently, "You're too thin. You need to nourish yourself. Eat up, take whatever you like, don't be shy. I'll talk business with them, you don’t need to worry about me."

The old Zhou Yunsheng would have been attentive at the dinner table, picking out the dishes Cao Moken favored with just a glance. That’s why Cao Moken had to give the last instruction.

But now, Zhou Yunsheng didn’t care about him. He quietly ate, thinking that once he was full, he would figure out how to deal with this self-important big shark.

Although it was a dinner, Cao Moken didn’t touch a single grain of rice. After finishing the business talk, he immediately asked the boy to leave, instructing them to leave their business cards with Yu Meilian. His intention to make Zhou Yunsheng famous was obvious.

Connections were the greatest asset for a manager. With these connections, Wu Tao was nothing. He wasn’t even worthy of helping him put on his shoes! Yu Meilian’s face turned red with excitement as she carefully kept the business cards. Seeing the boss's impatience, she quickly left, selling out her teammate effectively.

"Is it good? Do you want me to give you some more?" Cao Moken hugged the boy’s shoulders, his tone affectionate.

"No, I'm full." Zhou Yunsheng put down his chopsticks, ready to wipe his mouth, but Cao Moken had already extended a napkin, carefully wiping his mouth for him.


"If you're full then let's go."Cao Merkun rightfully went to hold the teenager's hand.

"Uncle Cao, what exactly do you mean?"Zhou Yunsheng sat down and refused to get up, trying to break away from the other party's grip but realizing that he was powerless.It was impossible!The body that had been remodeled was far beyond normal in both strength and speed, with a force value that broke through the heavens, so how could this have happened?

Because of this accident, Zhou Yunsheng was no longer as calm as before.

Cao Merkun hooked his lips and smiled, "I can't see that you have quite a lot of strength in this small body."More and more, he wrapped his arms around the teenager tightly, sat down smoothly, and laughed, "Am I not following your wishes?You want to seduce me, I'll let you seduce me, you want to be red, I'll let you be red, what else are you not satisfied with?"

"I seduced you before because I lacked money, but now that I've shot the commercial, I already have money."Unable to resist, Zhou Yunsheng had to show weakness, blinking a pair of watery peach blossom eyes, looking over pitifully.

Cao Merkun's eyes darkened, he simply sat him in his lap, biting his ear and whispering, "I know you're close to me for money, could it still be because you love me?You have to think clearly, but five hundred thousand, buy a few bags a few pieces of clothing will spend almost, you again from where to find money?It's better to follow me, I can give you whatever you want."Before the words fell, he could not restrain himself from biting on the teenager's earlobe, little by little grinding with his teeth, inch by inch exploring with the tip of his tongue, probing straight into the cochlea.

Zhou Yunsheng was teased-softened, breathing in fresh air in a big gulp, trying to bring himself back to his senses, but the strong male scent made him more and more addicted.This embrace was too familiar, even if the soul could not distinguish it, the instinct that remained in the body was completely irresistible.

Yet in his panic, he managed to ignore the familiarity.

CaoMoKun originally just want to tease a little bit and then stop, which unexpectedly do the back actually can't stop.Teenager's skin is too white, too smooth, too creamy, presenting the curdled cow's milk general texture, make him want to sip all over his body, see if he can suck out a mouthful of sweet milk.

"Look at you, baby, you're all red."He pulled open the teenager's lapel and poked his large palm inside, laughing softly, "Stop playing lustful tricks with me.How much do you want, just make a price."

"I don't want money, and I won't follow you, I have a boyfriend!"Zhou Yunsheng refused under his breath.

"Boyfriend?Ji Han Yu?Don't be ridiculous baby, didn't you figure out his money when you were with him?Now that his family is broke, he can't give you anything.Don't tell me you love him more than money."Cao Merkun laughed lowly, thinking that love was the most ridiculous thing in the world.

"I love money, who in the world doesn't love money?I approached you in the first place because I needed money in an emergency.If I could, I would never betray Han Yu, you're right, I do love him more than money."Zhou Yunsheng was held underneath and almost cried out, the teardrops hanging on his eyelashes hanging but not falling, looking cute to the extreme.

Cao Merkun kissed away the crystallized teardrops, pressed his hips towards his own greatness, panting and speaking, "Okay, you love him.I also don't want you to leave him.You follow me for three months, after three months I'll let you go free, and I'll also give you a large sum of money, guaranteeing that I won't let Ji Han Yu know.Are you satisfied like this?"

"No, the problem is that I don't even want your money right now!Uncle Cao please let go, raping a minor is a felony, I will definitely sue you!"Zhou Yunsheng struggled violently.

Cao Merkun could barely hold onto him and had to let go.Although there were ways for him to escape the law, the fact that forcing someone to sleep with him was meaningless, and he disdained it.

"Go away, I'll give you a few days to think about it."He used his fingertips to comb through his messy hair, and at the end of the day, he pulled out a cigar and cut it open to light it, his deep eyes full of mockery, "You have to grasp the degree of wanting to whet people's appetites, when you come back to beg me again, it won't be for the same price as it is now."In the end, he still didn't believe the teenager's so-called true love speech.

Hang your sister's appetite!Zhou Yunsheng glared at him fiercely and quickly left after putting on his down jacket.

"It's even more beautiful when you're angry."Cao Merkun exhaled a mouthful of smoke, and the hard-joint in his crotch bounced violently as it was stimulated by the teenager's furiously rolling, luscious eyes.


＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝

Chapter 4.6

Since Zhou Yunsheng was in good condition, the entire commercial was filmed in just one day. Orlando personally handled the editing. When he walked out of the studio, his face was flushed, his eyes were dazed, and he looked as though he had drunk several large barrels of strong liquor.

"Boss, here's the sample. Take a look. I have a feeling this perfume is going to be a hit in Country C, no, it’s going to take over the whole world. I’m not planning to re-shoot the European advertisement; I’ll just use this one."

"Just put it aside. I'll watch it later." Cao Moken said, flipping through a document without even raising his head.

Orlando had hoped to see his astonished expression, but seeing him uninterested, he walked away in disappointment.

Once the person left, Cao Moken immediately stood up, locked the office door, took off his coat, loosened his tie, poured himself a glass of red wine, and inserted the disc into the computer.

The female singer’s ambiguous chanting slowly flowed out:

close you’re eyes,
fear,
r',
he's on the run
y’s here.
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy,
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy.
p,
le prayer,
every day in every way,
it'r,
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy,
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy.
……

Cao Moken's indifferent gaze gradually became focused and heated.

While in the studio, he had just sat there observing, feeling somewhat restricted, but this commercial used entirely overhead shots, and the visual impact created by a different perspective was stunning.

The boy’s eyes were glazed, his cheeks flushed, as he was drunk, and his lips were slightly dry. He frowned in discomfort, extended his tongue to lick them, turning the dryness into a vibrant, tempting look. But this did not quench his thirst. So, he grabbed a handful of flower petals and crushed them, sucking the fresh, red flower juice. Afterward, he sighed in satisfaction, letting out a sweet fragrance as he casually smeared the juice across his pale chest.

He was the most beautiful presence within the frame, the colorful petals fading in comparison to him.

As the series of affectionate "beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy" played, he slowly closed his eyes. A tear hung from his long, curled eyelashes, his sleeping face peaceful.

The screen gradually blurred, and gilded Gothic font appeared — Decay, the enchantress of flavor.

There was not a single shot in the film directly related to the perfume, but one could almost smell the scent of flowers at their peak, enveloped in a sweet yet decaying fragrance. This was an advertisement that could mesmerize anyone.

Cao Moken had already set his wine glass aside, staring intently at the screen. The longest commercial duration of 60 seconds felt too short, too brief that just by blinking, the boy full of magnetic charm disappeared.

He hurriedly went to press the repeat play button, imagining the teenager's red mouth being sucked by himself, imagining the teenager's body being caressed by himself, imagining the teenager crying and begging for mercy underneath him, his eyelashes stained with crystalline teardrops.

He was obsessed with conjuring up images of their lovemaking in his mind, and surprisingly reached the ultimate enjoyment of his senses without the need for soothing.

*!When he came back to his senses, he stared at his crotch which was moistened in a ball, his face clouded.Sprinting into the rest room to take a cold shower, he called Yu Meilian while donning his bathrobe.

Zhou Yunsheng had been waiting for Aya to transfer money into his account. He was never one to lack money, but the current situation—calculating which dish was cheaper and had more servings for a meal—was unbearable.

After waiting for nearly seven or eight days, borrowing a few hundred yuan from Fang Youran, and enduring a cold sarcasm from Ji Hanyu, he couldn't stand it any longer and called Yu Meilian for help.

"I’m not sure about this. You should call Mr. Cao to ask," Yu Meilian quickly passed the matter onto someone else.

Zhou Yunsheng had no choice but to call Cao Mukun.

Cao Mukun picked up the phone almost immediately. Before the first ring had even ended, his deep and sexy voice came through, "Baby, have you thought it through?"

Zhou Yunsheng frowned and got straight to the point, "When are you going to pay me my fee?"

"Didn't you read the contract, baby? The contract states that payment will be made only after the advertisement is released."

"So when is it going to be released?"

"The sample video is still under review. I heard it’s a bit too risqué, so it might get banned."

"Are you saying if it’s banned, I won’t get paid? What kind of unreasonable clause is that?" Zhou Yunsheng was so angry that his teeth were grinding. If he hadn't just started in the entertainment industry and wanted to have a bit of fun, he wouldn't have ended up in this situation. He thought if it was going to turn out like this, he should have just gone to sell some small software, who cares if it's out of character.

"That's how the contract is written." Hearing the teenager's strained breath, Cao Mukun felt a wave of heat, adjusted his tie, and unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt, licking his lips as he comforted, "But don't worry, baby. We're planning to release the ad in the European and American markets. Once it gets approved there, we'll pay you."

"How long will it take to release it in the European and American markets?" Zhou Yunsheng patiently asked. After all, this was his hard-earned money, and he couldn't just let it go.

"I don’t know yet. Let’s wait and see. By the way, I heard there’s not much money left in your account. I heard you’ve been eating at the school cafeteria, just egg flower soup and a vegetable dish every day. Baby, you’re not taking care of yourself. Come to Uncle’s place, I’ll treat you to a big meal, and after that, you can have a sweet lollipop."

The man's deliberately lowered voice was full of suggestive undertones, making Zhou Yunsheng’s ears burn with embarrassment.

"Go to hell!" He slammed the phone down, grinding his teeth in anger.

"Such a bad temper." Cao Mukun stared at the phone screen where the intoxicated, hazy-eyed teenager smiled victoriously, feeling a sense of triumph.

When the teenager returned to his seat, his cheeks were flushed, his eyes bright, and his lips pouted slightly from unhappiness, making him look extremely cute. Ji Hanyu couldn't help but glance at him over and over but resisted the urge to talk to him.

Because of the bankruptcy pretense, Lin Chengze’s attitude towards Ji Hanyu had already changed drastically. Although they hadn't reached the point of confrontation, he was clearly much more perfunctory than before. If it were someone else, they would have tried hard to please and appease Ji Hanyu to change the situation, but Zhou Yunsheng was different.

He never liked to flatter others, only focusing on slapping faces.

Both of them returned home, each with their own thoughts. Fang Youran had already cooked dinner. Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t understand how a person who worked four jobs every day had so much time to spend in the kitchen.

"Eat while it’s hot. There’s not much food today, but bear with it. Once I get my paycheck, I’ll buy a chicken and improve the meal," he said with a smile, serving them rice. His strong and optimistic attitude moved Ji Hanyu deeply. He wished he could tell him right now that he didn't need to work anymore, he could take care of him.

But since his plan to mess with Lin Chengze hadn’t been achieved, he held back.

The three of them ate in silence. Fang Youran took out a bankbook from his pocket and handed it over. "Hanyu, this is the money I’ve saved from my part-time jobs. You can keep it for emergencies. Didn’t you say your factory would be taken over if it doesn’t get more investment?"

Ji Hanyu was stunned for a moment before taking the bankbook. He looked at the small amount of money—something he would never have cared about before—and his eyes grew red. To have someone stand by him in his time of need, this was the kind of relationship he had always longed for, and now he had finally found it.

Zhou Yunsheng leaned over and glanced at it, then casually said, "What can 20,000 yuan do? You should take it back."

One person was helping with all his might, the other observing coldly. Their completely opposite attitudes made Ji Hanyu’s dislike for Lin Chengze grow deeper, while his affection for Fang Youran grew stronger. But he wouldn’t show his dislike for Lin Chengze in front of Fang Youran, so he agreed, "Yeah, Youran, this amount of money is useless, you should take it back. I’ll think of another way."

Fang Youran was insistent, and after some back and forth, it was only when Ji Hanyu teasingly scratched his palm that he blushed and reluctantly agreed, looking down and not daring to look at his friend.

Zhou Yunsheng thought he was done with the matter and was about to return to his room when he heard Fang Youran hesitantly speak, "Xiao Ze, why don’t you mortgage the house? That would definitely help Hanyu."

What did you say? Zhou Yunsheng nearly wanted to dig his ears. This house belonged to Lin Chengze, and Fang Youran was just renting. What right did he have to say such a thing? A saint? Saint my ass!

Fang Youran was stunned under his cold, sharp gaze. Ji Hanyu immediately stepped in front of his beloved, agreeing, "Yeah, Xiao Ze, mortgage the house to help me get a loan. I’ll pay you back as soon as my factory starts operating."

Knowing full well that Lin Chengze wouldn’t agree, he still wanted to make things difficult for him. Making Lin Chengze uncomfortable had become his new source of enjoyment.

"Sorry, this house can’t be mortgaged," Zhou Yunsheng said coldly, his gaze shifting between the two. "You should know, this is the only heirloom left by my parents, and I wouldn’t touch it even if I die. If you need money, I’ll figure something out. No need to rush. I’m tired. I’ll go rest in my room."

He nodded at the two of them before slamming the door shut. Ji Hanyu thought Zhou Yunsheng’s "I’ll figure something out" was just an excuse, and he smirked when Zhou Yunsheng turned his back.

At the end of the day, the entanglement between Lin Chengze and Ji Hanyu was a matter between a benefactor and a pet—one wanted money, the other wanted affection, both were getting what they needed. What right did Ji Hanyu have to get back at Lin Chengze? What right did he have to ruin Lin Chengze’s life?

Since he didn't know to stop, Zhou Yunsheng was going to let him deeply experience what is called 'selfless and great love', fearing that he wouldn't be able to bear it at that time.

Hooking his lips playfully, he picked up his cell phone and dialed.

"Baby, figured it out yet?"Cao Merkun picked up the phone within a second.

"Figured it out, you have to ......"

His words were interrupted by the man's deep voice before he finished, "Baby come out, let's talk face to face.How can you talk about something like this over the phone?"

"Okay, where to meet?"Zhou Yunsheng's tone was disheveled, but his expression was a little evil, his fingertips wrapping around a strand of hair at the corner of his forehead without a beat.

"At my private club, I'll have the driver pick you up."

"Okay."

Zhou Yunsheng was about to hang up the phone when the other end demanded forcefully, "Baby don't give me a goodbyekiss?"

Kiss your sister!Zhou Yunsheng's forehead twitched, but he still printed a loud kiss to the microphone, and the man's low and pleasant laughter came from that end.

The phone finally hung up, Zhou Yunsheng casually picked a white shirt with a round neck sweater, outside a down jacket, took the phone and keys to go out.

There was no one in the living room, Fang You Ran went back to the bedroom, Ji Han Yu followed him in and didn't know what he was doing inside.
