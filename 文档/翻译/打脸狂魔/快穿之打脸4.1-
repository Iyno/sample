Chapter 4.1
Zhou Yunsheng had spent his entire life with Emperor Tianqi, yet they had never once quarreled. Before his death, Emperor Tianqi clutched his hand tightly, demanding that he be buried with him. The mad love in his eyes was deeply moving.

Without hesitation, Zhou Yunsheng agreed. When he caught sight of the dazzling light in the emperor’s eyes at that moment, he felt that he had made the right decision.

Back in the Star Sea Space, he stood amidst the stars, absorbing the power of that world. However, he soon realized that half of the energy within the vortex was being siphoned away, flowing toward an unknown destination beyond his perception.

How could this be? Could it be the Supreme God?

He frowned and quickly dismissed the thought. If the Supreme God had the ability to seize his power, he should have long discovered his existence and would have already attempted to eliminate him. Yet, there was no reaction at all, which meant it wasn’t the Supreme God.

Then who could it be?

A thought surfaced in his mind, but he didn’t dare dwell on it too deeply—he feared that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

After extracting the power, he fell into a deep sleep. When he woke up again, he was sitting in a bright classroom, surrounded by the sound of students reading aloud.

Glancing at the English textbook on his desk, he immediately found the section being read and followed along while simultaneously browsing through the information in his intellectual brain.

After traveling through countless worlds of harem and power-leveling plots, this time, he had finally entered a *world.

This body belonged to Lin Chengze. His parents had passed away, leaving him with several hundred thousand yuan in savings and an apartment. The original host could have used this money to study through university, find a job, and live a stable life. However, he was an extremely vain person with a severe materialistic mindset. When his parents were alive, he wore luxury brands and expensive watches. After their passing, without any restraints, his habits became even worse.

He squandered his savings in no time and had no choice but to resort to deceitful means.

Lin Chengze was gay and had a strong instinct for recognizing others of the same kind. He discovered that one of his classmates, the son of a wealthy family, was also gay and deliberately seduced him. That young master was naturally flirtatious and originally intended to toy with Lin Chengze before giving him some money and tossing him aside.

However, Lin Chengze was overheard chatting with a friend in the restroom, saying that he was only interested in the young master’s wealth, calling him stupid and rich.

The young master felt deeply insulted and was about to storm in to teach Lin Chengze a lesson, but his mischievous friend held him back, suggesting that instead of a simple beating, they should humiliate Lin Chengze thoroughly before discarding him.

The young master agreed and pretended that his family had gone bankrupt. He moved in with Lin Chengze and deliberately introduced him to his wealthy friends.

Lin Chengze, oblivious to the scheme, stepped right into the trap. Though he didn’t openly fall out with the young master, he began seducing his friends in secret. As a result, he was used by multiple people, and countless compromising photos were taken.

If it had ended there, it might not have been so bad. However, the young master genuinely fell in love with Lin Chengze’s closest friend, and Lin Chengze found out.

The young master then revealed everything, admitting that it was all a setup.

While Lin Chengze was devastated, those explicit photos were plastered all over the school walls. His friends abandoned him, and he lost his chance to take the college entrance exam. From then on, he could only survive by selling his body, ultimately contracting AIDS and dying.

After his death, his closest friend merely sighed, while the young master scoffed, saying he deserved it.

After reviewing Lin Chengze’s life, Zhou Yunsheng’s face darkened completely. He slowly turned to glance at the handsome young man sitting to his right.

This was the "poor" young master—Ji Hanyu, the protagonist gong of this world. The protagonist shou was Lin Chengze’s best friend, Fang Youran, who studied at a different school and had the personality of a "white lotus."

A green tea bitch and a white lotus—it was obvious who the protagonist gong would fall for.

At present, Ji Hanyu was pretending his family had gone bankrupt and had already moved into Lin Chengze’s home. Meanwhile, he was subtly developing feelings for Fang Youran, who was also staying at Lin’s house. At the same time, Lin Chengze, under Ji Hanyu’s influence, had set his sights on Ji Hanyu’s uncle, Cao Mokun, and was secretly trying to seduce him.

Of course, Ji Hanyu’s romance would end happily, while Lin Chengze would be treated as nothing by Cao Mokun. Lin Chengze repeatedly hinted at his feelings, but Cao Mokun never responded. Eventually, Lin Chengze turned to seducing others, leading to his downfall.

Understanding his situation, Zhou Yunsheng rubbed his face and continued looking at Lin Chengze’s regrets before his death.

The first regret: falling into Ji Hanyu’s trap, which led to his ruin.

The second regret: failing to take the college entrance exam.

The third regret: being forced into prostitution and unable to support himself independently.

Fortunately, the current Lin Chengze had only just begun pursuing Cao Mokun. Since Cao was a mature and steady adult, he merely warned his nephew not to be deceived. This meant there was still time to avoid the leaked photos incident.

As for the other two regrets, they were nothing for Zhou Yunsheng, who had an IQ of 180.

With that in mind, this world didn’t seem so bad after all.

Zhou Yunsheng picked up the English book and smiled mischievously. As a vengeful person, merely avoiding danger wasn’t his style—he was going to humiliate Ji Hanyu and make him realize that the world didn’t revolve around him.

“Chengze, let’s go.” As soon as the class bell rang, Ji Hanyu grabbed his backpack and kicked Zhou Yunsheng’s chair. He couldn’t wait to see Fang Youran.

“Alright, give me a second.” Zhou Yunsheng slowly packed his bag.

Ji Hanyu’s impatience was evident. He exchanged a quick glance with his friends by the classroom door—one full of malicious intent.

“Alright, let’s go.” Zhou Yunsheng pretended not to notice anything, slung his backpack over his shoulder, and walked out first.

Back home, Fang Youran was wearing a Winnie-the-Pooh apron, cooking in the kitchen. His delicate face was flushed red from the stove’s heat, making him look soft and adorable.

Ji Hanyu’s eyes lit up. He tossed his bag onto the sofa and hurried into the kitchen to help. The two stood close together, speaking in hushed tones, looking quite intimate.

The original Lin Chengze disliked the dirty kitchen and never stepped foot in it, so he was completely unaware of their growing bond.

Now, Zhou Yunsheng had no interest in the kitchen either. He simply took his bag and went straight to his room.

Fang Youran was an orphan—a gentle and virtuous housewife-like character. With his meticulous cleanliness contrasting Lin Chengze’s vanity and materialism, it was no surprise Ji Hanyu fell for him.

At this point, they had already shared their first kiss, though Ji Hanyu had forced it.

After checking his body in the mirror, Zhou Yunsheng couldn't deny that the original host's appearance was exceptionally beautiful—no wonder he later became a top escort.

Satisfied with his looks, he quickly showered and turned on the computer to play games. After decades in the Great Zhou dynasty, he had nearly forgotten what it felt like to use a keyboard.

Just as he was getting into the game, Fang Youran’s voice came from outside.

“Chengze, dinner’s ready.”

Zhou Yunsheng responded, but when he checked Lin Chengze’s bank balance before shutting down the computer, his face instantly turned green.

Only 200 yuan left.

No wonder Lin Chengze was so eager to find a new sugar daddy.

From this perspective, the ability to be self-sufficient must be prioritized. Although he could hack into a bank vault with just a few keystrokes, that wouldn't be self-sufficiency—it would be a crime. Lin Chengze had already gone down the wrong path once; he couldn't afford to make the same mistake again.

As a competent impersonator, he preferred to rely on the original skills of the person he was impersonating to make a living. Not only did this align with his aesthetic standards, but it also enhanced his survival ability. Any skill possessed by the villains he had played, he would diligently master until he could wield it even better than the original. Of course, in cases like Shen Yibin—who was utterly useless and driven to a dead end—he could only improvise.

What skills did Lin Chengze have? After thinking it over, it seemed that his only asset was his stunning appearance.

Zhou Yunsheng narrowed his eyes. In a world where looks mattered, that alone was more than enough.

While contemplating his future plans, he walked into the dining room and saw Ji Hanyu helping Fang Youran serve the dishes, repeatedly reminding him to be careful not to burn his hands.

"Let's eat." Zhou Yunsheng sat down, tapping his fingertips lightly on the table. A fleeting trace of authority escaped from him before he quickly concealed it.

Ji Hanyu and Fang Youran didn't notice, too busy serving food to each other.

"When are you going home? Your mother must be heartbroken. Aren't you going back to see her?" he asked casually.

"She doesn’t need me to. She already ran off with someone else." Ji Hanyu sneered. Fang Youran glanced at him with concern.

Zhou Yunsheng picked up a piece of tofu and continued, "Then what do you plan to do?"

Keep chasing my dear and messing with you while I’m at it, Ji Hanyu sneered internally. But on the surface, he looked troubled and sighed, "I plan to work while continuing my studies. Wang Jie recently suggested that we start a factory together, but I don’t have the capital."

"How much do you need? I can lend you some. I’ve saved up a bit from my part-time jobs," Fang Youran offered immediately.

Ji Hanyu smiled—not the kind that didn’t reach his eyes, but a genuine smile. "How could I take your money? It’s 300,000 yuan—selling you wouldn’t even get that much. You should use your money to buy yourself a few down jackets. It’s the middle of winter, and you’re just wearing two sweaters and a coat. Aren’t you cold?"

Fang Youran was naturally frugal and kind-hearted. The fact that he was willing to offer help without hesitation when Ji Hanyu was at his lowest touched him deeply. In contrast, Lin Chengze, who was only focused on eating and pretending not to hear anything, paled in comparison.
