Chapter 21: The Cook 20

Tang Jiu stretched his neck as far as he could to look into the clay pot, but Lin Dan pushed him away and teased, "Take it easy, don't fall in, or I'll braise you along with it."

Tang Jiu burst into laughter, his eyes shining as he gazed at her. "The soup you make is completely different from others'."

Lin Dan spoke calmly, "The Lüshi Chunqiu’s Ben Wei chapter states: 'Among all flavors, water is the foundation. With the five flavors, three ingredients, and nine boils and transformations… the ultimate taste is achieved.' These three pots of soup are made with sweet, clear mountain spring water, infused with secret spices, and cooked over fragrant pinewood. Each time it boils, I add an ingredient, repeating the process nine times to enhance the flavor layer by layer, until it reaches perfection. Flavors can be salty or sweet, aromas strong or mild. My braising broth is made using my own ‘Unique Aroma Flavor Enhancement Method,’ making it far richer than ordinary ones."

As she spoke, Lin Dan placed the braised chicken, duck, and pork knuckle into a food box. Then, she sliced the large pieces of pork belly and prepared a dipping sauce before continuing, "Aged braising broth is always the best, so fresh ingredients must be added continuously. Take these cooked dishes home and enjoy them at your leisure—it’s my way of thanking you for looking after me these past days."

"No need to thank me," Tang Jiu said politely, but his hands honestly reached out to take the food box. Then, he asked, "I remember you also put pig skin in there earlier. Where is it?" He particularly loved braised pig skin and couldn't help asking.

Lin Dan pointed at the pork knuckle and belly, chuckling, "See these? They’ve been deep-fried, so their crispy outer layer protects the tender meat inside, preventing them from falling apart in the broth. But the pig skin was fresh and unfried. After several hours, it has melted into a thick gelatin and blended into the broth. Good braising broth should be both fragrant and sticky. And where does that richness come from? From the fats and gelatin. Without melting the pig skin, how could I make a new broth taste like an aged one? If you like, next time I can fry the pig skin first before braising it, then let it cool for you to pick up."

Lin Dan spoke about food as if reciting a scripture, effortlessly revealing secrets that others might take a lifetime to learn. Tang Jiu listened, completely captivated. Swallowing hard, he emphasized, "Make sure to braise extra pig skin next time—I’ll come back for it. If you run into any trouble, go to the Ministry of War and find me. I’m stationed there."

Lin Dan neither questioned Tang Jiu’s identity nor showed any nervousness about befriending an influential figure. She simply smiled and nodded, seeing him off.

To her surprise, Tang Jiu seemed slightly disappointed that she didn't ask more. Even as he walked far away, he kept turning back with a complicated expression.

At the alley entrance, he saw a few men rushing out of a gambling house, shouting, "That amazing smell is gone! Who the hell was cooking? It’s too damn tempting! Forget gambling—let’s go home and eat!"

Moments later, the entire alley came alive with people opening their doors, sniffing the air and looking around with greedy expressions. The incredible aroma of the braised broth was truly extraordinary.

Tang Jiu chuckled as he carried his food box away, shaking his head. Behind him, whispers filled the street—

"Who was braising meat just now? Did you smell that? It was incredible!"

Upon entering the government office, Tang Jiu immediately noticed Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou gathered around, eating something with a faintly sweet fragrance. The aroma was enticing. Zhao Liu raised his chopsticks and greeted him, "Hey, Boss, you’re finally here! We’re already eating."

"You accepted another food box from Yan Langqing?" Tang Jiu’s pleased expression darkened. "How many times have I told you—no matter what she says, don’t let her in, and don’t accept her food! Are you all ignoring me?"

A delicate food box sat on his desk, its lid already open. Inside, four exquisite dishes—both meat and vegetable—were plated in fine, white porcelain bowls. Zhao Liu and the others had also received a box, though theirs contained more food but lacked the refined presentation, clearly meant to bribe them.

As the saying goes, "A favor received is a debt owed." Having frequently enjoyed Yan Langqing’s gifts, Zhao Liu and the others naturally spoke on her behalf.

"Boss, you should just marry Chef Yan already. You love good food, and you’re picky. If you don’t marry a top imperial chef like her, who else could possibly satisfy you? Even the Noble Consort has approved the match! We’d be lucky to marry someone like her—her cooking is incredible! You won’t find another wife like her even if you searched with a lantern. Stop being so stubborn and just propose already!"

Tang Jiu stared at the ornate food box for a long while before letting out a cold laugh. "You can have this food box. From now on, if she sends anything, eat it yourselves—I won’t stop you."

The men beamed, thrilled at the prospect, but then their leader added, "But from now on, none of you will get a share of my food."

The so-called “leader’s food” was undoubtedly prepared by the marquis' top chefs. But how could that compare to the Imperial Kitchen’s head chef? Without hesitation, the men grinned and agreed, "Alright, alright! From now on, we’ll handle Chef Yan’s food for you!" They quickly grabbed the food box from Tang Jiu’s desk.

"Good, it’s settled." Tang Jiu bent down, pulled out a jar of fine liquor, popped the seal, and poured himself a drink. Then, he opened Lin Dan’s food box, unveiling a steaming braised chicken. Lifting the next layer, he found a braised duck, then a braised pork knuckle, and finally, thinly sliced braised pork belly. Each piece was garnished with sesame seeds and chopped scallions, accompanied by a small dish of vibrant red garlic chili sauce. A powerful aroma instantly filled the room.

Tang Jiu casually picked up a chicken claw and gently pulled—instantly, the entire leg separated, its tender meat and silky skin glistening with flavorful juices. A bite revealed a rich, savory taste. The pork knuckle had been simmered to perfection—its skin burst with a gentle suck, the meat melted in his mouth, and the tendons retained just the right amount of chewiness. The pork belly, evenly marbled with fat and lean meat, carried a deep umami richness. A few chews blended the fatty juices with the tender texture, enhanced by the pungent garlic and fiery chili—a truly divine combination.

He devoured several bites, then, seemingly choked, quickly took a swig of strong liquor, sighing in satisfaction.

The room was unusually silent. When he looked up, he found Zhao Liu and the others frozen in place, their eyes practically glowing green as they stared at his food box.

"Get lost," he sneered.

"But Boss! Where did you buy that braised meat? It smells too damn good! Just give us one bite!" Zhao Liu shamelessly pleaded.

The dishes Yan Langqing sent were served in dainty porcelain plates, their flavors mild and delicate, and the portions minuscule—one bite was enough to finish an entire dish. They were delicious, but unsatisfying. In contrast, Tang Jiu’s food was bold, rich, and meaty—real food for real men! Tearing off a whole chicken leg, stuffing it into his mouth, and washing it down with burning liquor—that was the kind of meal that could send a man straight to heaven!

"Boss! Please, just one bite! We swear, from now on, we’ll never touch Chef Yan’s food again!" Zhao Liu and the others surrounded him, practically drooling into his dishes.

"Get lost!" Tang Jiu repeated, finishing his meal before having the leftovers sent home for a late-night snack.

Zhao Liu and the others clutched their chests in agony, swearing never to accept Yan Langqing’s food again. That aroma was too overpowering—it had stolen their very souls.

Ignoring them, Tang Jiu left for the military camp.

Good food was meant to be savored alone—why would he share?

……

Lin Dan had a dreamless night. The next morning, she got up early, first kneading the dough and letting it rest under a damp cloth. Then, she cooked porridge and prepared the ingredients, getting ready to welcome customers. Most of the servants who had accompanied her back to the capital had already left, leaving only Xiao Zhu and two literate waiters. Meanwhile, Peony and Azalea were in charge of helping in the kitchen.

"We're only selling noodles and porridge?" Peony asked curiously, noticing that her master hadn't prepared any other ingredients.

"In the morning, people should eat lightly. A bowl of porridge or noodles is enough. Besides, those who wake up before dawn are usually hardworking commoners rushing off to work. They don’t have much money to spare, so ordering a simple bowl of plain porridge or Yangchun noodles is already a luxury for them. We’ll serve only noodles and porridge in the morning, offer a full menu at noon with rice, noodles, and vegetables, and then close early in the afternoon. We won’t do business in the evening because there are several brothels and gambling houses nearby, making things quite chaotic later in the day," Lin Dan patiently explained.

A nearby dock frequently received merchant ships, and several escort agencies had been set up to facilitate the transport of goods. With an increasing number of merchants traveling north and south, brothels, gambling houses, and inns naturally flourished, gradually forming a unique business district. Those who woke up early were either dockworkers, boatmen, or bodyguards—none of whom were wealthy. But by noon, a diverse crowd would emerge: the rich and the poor, those from the underworld and the authorities, government officials or wealthy merchants traveling by water. This place was a true mix of people from all walks of life.

Opening a restaurant in such a bustling area satisfied Lin Dan greatly. She couldn’t understand why the Yan family thought she would suffer a huge loss.

Smiling, Lin Dan shook her head. As dawn approached, the sound of footsteps rustled through the street. She instructed Xiao Zhu and the two waiters to carry the large earthen pot of braised broth outside and place it at the entrance, setting up a few stoves beneath it to let it simmer gently over a low flame.

"Remove the cloth strips, lift the lid, and give it a good stir with the long ladle," she called out.

Xiao Zhu followed her instructions. But as soon as he lifted the lid, an intense wave of fragrance rushed out, making his head spin. His mouth watered instantly, and he nearly drooled into the broth. Hastily covering his mouth, he turned away and handed the ladle to another waiter, gulping, "You stir it—I haven’t even had breakfast yet!"

"I haven’t eaten either!" The waiter quickly swallowed his saliva before stirring.

The moment he stirred the broth, the already rich aroma intensified, spreading rapidly in all directions. The scent drifted through the alleyways, markets, and docks, filling the entire area in an instant. Those nearby found themselves restless, unable to sit still as the irresistible fragrance teased their senses.

Chapter 22: The Cook 21

Lin Dan did not stay in the kitchen but instead had the shop assistant set up a simple stall at the entrance of the restaurant. Inside the stall, she arranged a stove, pots, bowls, a chopping board, knives, and other utensils. She then washed her hands and face, using a cloth to completely gather and tie up her long hair to prevent any strands from falling into the food.

After stirring the braising sauce, Xiao Zhu pitifully pleaded, "Sister Lin, can you cook us a bowl of noodles? We’ll work better on a full stomach!"

Lin Dan cast him a sideways glance with a smile, then cut a piece from the rested dough, quickly pulling it into thin, silken noodles before placing them into the boiling spring water. She lined up five large bowls and ladled in a scoop of creamy-white bone broth for each. Once the noodles were cooked, she thinly sliced some braised meat and arranged the pieces neatly on top. She added a few cooked leafy greens, placed half a braised egg into the soup, and finally sprinkled chopped scallions and cilantro on top.

"Eat up, and get to work once you're done," Lin Dan said. The moment she finished speaking, Xiao Zhu and the others cheered, each grabbing a bowl and slurping up their noodles eagerly.

"Master, the noodles are so springy! The rich aroma of the braised meat blends perfectly with the fresh flavor of the bone broth—it's just the right balance, neither too salty nor too bland. Can I have another bowl?" Shaoyao praised while eating.

"Sure, I'll make another one. You and Dujuan can share," Lin Dan agreed. Since the kids were still growing, their appetites were naturally large, and she had no problem providing them with extra food. She turned around to continue pulling the noodles when Xiao Zhu curiously asked, "Boss, why did you move the kitchen outside? It seems inconvenient with all the people passing by!"

"It's actually for convenience that I moved it outside. Customers can tell me their preferred noodle style and portion size as soon as they enter, and I can prepare it right away. Freshly boiled noodles taste the best—smooth, chewy, and distinct. If they sit for even a moment, they clump together, affecting the texture. At noon, when we cook stir-fried dishes, the oil smoke would be too strong and might choke the customers, so we'll move everything back inside then," Lin Dan explained. She always pursued perfection in her culinary skills, prioritizing the dining experience, and arranged everything in the most customer-friendly way.

Xiao Zhu and the others nodded in understanding. Just then, a deep voice sounded from outside the door. "Lin Dan, being your customer must be one of the greatest joys in the world."

"You’re here again," Lin Dan said with a smile, shaking her head. "You're too kind. What kind of noodles would you like? I'll make them for you."

"I'm not picky. Just cook whatever you see fit," Tang Jiu said as he stepped through the door. Xiao Zhu and the others quickly greeted him and wiped down a table and chair for him.

Knowing that Tang Jiu was a true foodie who enjoyed all kinds of flavors, Lin Dan prepared him a bowl of braised noodle soup. After serving her first customer, she began preparing the minced topping. She retrieved a well-braised piece of pork belly from the sauce pot and finely diced it. Tossing it into another pan, she added dry wood as fuel and stir-fried it over high heat until fragrant. Then she gradually added diced tofu, bamboo shoots, and water bamboo, pouring in some clear broth to simmer everything into a rich, savory sauce.

"That smells amazing! Can I have some of that on my noodles?" Tang Jiu asked eagerly.

"Of course. Adding a scoop of topping costs one more copper coin," Lin Dan teased.

"I’d pay five more if needed," Tang Jiu replied, giving her a deep look. He mixed the topping into his noodles and took a big bite. His eyes instantly lit up. Using just half a pound of braised meat, Lin Dan had managed to infuse a whole pot of vegetables with a strong, meaty aroma—her cooking skills were truly remarkable.

Seeing his surprise, Lin Dan explained, "Most early-morning laborers aren’t wealthy and only get to eat meat during holidays. My braised meat noodles cost four coins a bowl, which some people might not afford. So, instead of serving pure meat, I use one piece of braised pork to make a pot of vegetable topping with a rich meat flavor. This way, more people can enjoy the taste of meat at a lower cost. Tofu, bamboo shoots, and water bamboo are all soft and absorbent ingredients. When simmered in the braising sauce, they take on the taste of the meat. This technique is called 'flavor infusion' in seasoning."

Unconsciously, Tang Jiu put down his bowl, listening intently as if entranced.

Meanwhile, the enticing aroma had already drawn many people to the area. They followed the scent, figuring that a nearby restaurant must be preparing breakfast for sale. Though most of them couldn't afford braised meat, they could at least get a bowl of plain noodles. The cook who could make such a fragrant braised dish surely had great culinary skills.

With this in mind, many people turned into the narrow alley. Even those who initially took a wrong turn quickly found their way by following the scent. Soon, a crowd gathered at the entrance of the restaurant. Their mouths watered as they saw the steaming pot of braising sauce, their hunger stirred by the sight of Tang Jiu happily slurping down his noodles, his face full of satisfaction.

"Boss, how much for a bowl of noodles?" a burly man asked, swallowing his saliva.

"Plain noodles, one coin. Minced topping noodles, two coins. Extra topping noodles, three coins. Braised meat noodles, four coins. I also sell plain congee for two coins," Lin Dan calmly stated.

Xiao Zhu and the others immediately stepped forward to warmly welcome the customers. "Dear guests, please come in if you'd like to eat!"

"The minced topping noodles are only two coins? This topping?" The burly man pointed at the large pot, his eyes sparkling. The braised meat had completely melted into the sauce, and the diced bamboo shoots, tofu, and water bamboo had absorbed its rich, dark color, looking just like pure braised meat. They also carried the same rich aroma, with an added hint of natural sweetness that meat alone lacked.

The man, not knowing the secret behind the dish, assumed that the minced topping was made purely of braised meat and was shocked. A bowl of meat-based topping noodles like this would cost at least five coins elsewhere.

"That's right, only two coins. My topping is made from vegetables, so there’s no waste," Lin Dan patiently explained.

"Then give me a bowl!" The man didn't hesitate anymore and stepped inside, secretly delighted. Who cares if it’s made of vegetables? As long as it tastes like meat, that’s all that matters.

He seemed to be the leader of a group, and as soon as he went in, the others followed, each ordering a bowl of minced topping noodles. Judging by their accents, they were all from the same place.

Lin Dan said softly, "Judging by your accents, you all seem to be from northern Shaanxi. How about I adjust the minced meat sauce to match your hometown flavor?"

"You can adjust the minced meat sauce flavor? That’s great!" The group nodded eagerly.

Lin Dan placed a pot on the vacant stove, poured in some oil, and waited until it heated to about 70% before adding chili powder to create a vibrant red oil. Since there were nine customers, she scooped out nine portions of minced meat sauce and stir-fried them briefly with the red oil. She then thickened the mixture with starch and, once the sauce was boiling, added finely chopped pickled cabbage to cook together with the minced meat. In this way, the originally savory minced meat sauce was transformed into a bright red, fiery, tangy, and salty Shaanxi-style sauce.

Once the sauce was ready, the noodles had also finished cooking. Lin Dan quickly scooped them into nine bowls, sprinkled them with minced ginger, scallions, and cilantro, and had Xiao Zhu and the others serve them.

The group of burly men had initially come just to try something new, but the moment they saw this familiar bowl of hometown noodles, their expressions turned emotional. They eagerly picked up their chopsticks, and after just one bite, their eyes glistened with unshed tears. The noodles were thin yet chewy, the sauce was both sour and spicy—just the right intensity. As the hot, flavorful food warmed their stomachs, long-buried memories of their hometown and childhood, things they didn’t even dare to think about on lonely nights, surfaced all at once. The nostalgia it evoked was powerful, yet at the same time, it soothed their homesickness.

"This is delicious! It tastes just like what I had as a child!" One of the men wolfed down a few more bites before speaking again, his voice slightly hoarse. His companions nodded repeatedly, looking deeply satisfied. After eating a bowl of these hometown noodles, they felt reinvigorated, ready to carry more cargo and earn more money.

"This is so good—I’m coming back tomorrow," one of them said, unable to part with his meal even before finishing it. The once monotonous and grueling life suddenly felt like it held something to look forward to.

"I’ll come too," the others chimed in. After all, nothing could beat the comfort of hometown food.

Soon, a few more people arrived at the shop. They were slightly shorter in stature and spoke with a thick accent that was difficult for most to understand. However, Lin Dan had traveled extensively and had a broad knowledge of different dialects, so she had no trouble communicating with them. She patiently explained the prices of the noodles and porridge.

After hesitating for a moment and staring at the pot of sauce, they finally gave in to temptation and stepped inside.

"Judging by your accents, you gentlemen must be from Baiyue. How about I adjust the minced meat sauce to suit your regional taste?" Lin Dan asked politely.

They exchanged skeptical glances but gave slight nods.

Lin Dan scooped out a few portions of minced meat sauce, diluted the intensity with water, and added some sugar. Then, she took a small jar from the stove and ladled out a few spoonfuls of a dark, murky sauce, mixing it into the prepared minced meat sauce. A pungent, briny aroma filled the air, which, once combined with the rich, savory fragrance of the minced meat sauce, became irresistibly fresh and appetizing, carrying a hint of the sea.

The skeptical expressions on the men’s faces were instantly replaced by surprise and delight. They chattered excitedly in their dialect, raising their thumbs in approval.

Lin Dan nodded and said, "That’s right, this is sand crab sauce. I made it myself—give it a try and see if it’s authentic."

People from Baiyue, especially those from the western regions, had a deep love for sand crab sauce. They used it in both meat and vegetable dishes and even incorporated it into noodle sauces, mixing it with sweet bean paste and fermented soybean paste. Lin Dan had spent a few months in Xiyue before, so she was well-versed in making authentic Xiyue-style minced meat noodles, known for their distinctive briny freshness.

With the sauce prepared, Lin Dan filled the bowls with noodles and ladled over a thick, milky broth. She then sprinkled pink shrimp skins and finely chopped green onions on top, making the dish look incredibly appetizing.

The men didn’t wait for Xiao Zhu and the others to serve them. Instead, they stood at the entrance, watching Lin Dan cook. As soon as the noodles were ready, they eagerly picked up their own bowls and started eating right away. No matter how many different cuisines they had tried, nothing could ever compare to the taste of home.

As the rich aroma continued to spread, more and more customers arrived. Lin Dan adjusted the flavors according to their preferences—adding Sichuan peppercorns and fermented broad bean paste for customers from Shu to create a numbing-spicy taste, making it fragrant-spicy for people from Hunan, and preparing other variations such as sour-spicy, scallion-infused, or even dry-mixed and oil-splashed noodles for those who preferred less broth.

It was often said that it was impossible to satisfy everyone’s tastes, yet in her hands, it seemed like the easiest thing in the world.

Chapter 23: The Cook, Part 22

Tang Jiu finished his noodles but didn’t leave. He walked over to Lin Dan’s side, holding the bowl, and whispered, “People from Nan Cheng are all migrants, they like to form groups. People from different regions each have their own local associations here. The largest associations have six: the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Association, the Sichuan Association, the Baiyue Association, the Jiangnan Association, the Hunan-Hubei Association, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Association. In the future, when you make the sauced noodles, just use six pots and prepare six different flavors. You don’t have to worry about other flavors, it’ll be too much trouble.”

“That’s a good idea. If any customers request a special flavor, I can make it for them. Thank you for the advice, Brother Tang,” Lin Dan said, smiling gratefully. She understood how to simplify the process, but she truly wasn’t familiar with the population structure of Nan Cheng.

“No need to thank me. Bring me another bowl of noodles, spicy and sour,” Tang Jiu said, tapping his empty bowl.

Lin Dan shook her head and smiled, quickly preparing another bowl of noodles.

Qin Erniang, in charge of serving customers, usually stayed up very late and slept in during the day, never getting up before the sun was high. But today was different. In her half-conscious state, she suddenly smelled an indescribably delicious fragrance. The smell was so strong and overwhelming that it made her mouth water and kept her tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. She struggled for a long time, then finally got up in one go, dressed quickly, and ran outside to investigate.

"Where is that smell of braised meat coming from? Go find it, and if you find it, buy half a pound of braised meat for me!" she ordered a few of the waiters.

"Erniang, we’ll go and have a look," the waiters said, still sleepy-eyed, clearly also drawn by the delicious scent. Soon, the girls upstairs also woke up and leaned over the railing, calling out sweetly, "We want to eat braised meat too, bring more back!"

The waiters promised to bring it, but they didn’t return. The fragrance grew stronger and eventually changed to a spicy-sour, onion-flavored scent, and many other delicious smells mixed together, making everyone's mouth water. Qin Erniang first waited in the hall, then went to the door to look, and later, unable to wait any longer, waved a handkerchief at the girls and said, “I’ll go out and take a look, you all go back to sleep.”

“Smells so good, how can we sleep?” the girls complained, rubbing their stomachs.

Qin Erniang was also completely tempted. Following the scent, she quickly ran to the alley at the intersection, turned a few corners, and found herself at the same small restaurant she had visited yesterday, the one she thought was bound to fail. She couldn’t help but be dumbfounded. She thought she had come to the wrong place but then stretched her neck to look and saw some of the waiters from her shop sitting inside, eating noodles eagerly, gulping them down with excitement.

The large clay pot at the door was steaming, and the thick fragrance continued to waft out. Qin Erniang, torn between her desires, finally gave in and, covering her face with her hands, walked in.

“Welcome, guest,” Xiao Zhu greeted her cheerfully, then was surprised, “Huh, you’re the one from yesterday…”

“Stop with the ‘this’ and ‘that,’ just give me half a pound of braised meat and another bowl of sauced noodles,” Qin Erniang said, her face flushed with embarrassment.

Lin Dan looked up from her work, and though she recognized Qin Erniang, she smiled warmly and said, “Sure, from the sound of your accent, you’re probably from Qianzhou, right? How about I prepare the braised meat with hot chili, wood ginger oil, and garlic water?”

At first, Qin Erniang felt awkward and worried that Lin Dan would mock her for yesterday’s remarks, but as soon as she heard Lin Dan’s words, she immediately relaxed, smiling widely like a flower. “Yes, yes, that’s how we make braised meat back home. Otherwise, it won’t have any flavor! I haven’t had this taste in over ten years!” she said, wiping her mouth with a handkerchief, fearing her saliva would spill.

“Not only do you make braised meat that way, but raw meat, pig liver, pig’s blood, and chicken blood can all be mixed that way. Especially the cold dish with raw pig meat and liver, finely chopped and mixed with rice wine, wood ginger, hot chili, garlic, and fragrant vinegar. It’s really refreshing,” Lin Dan casually added, not expecting to excite Qin Erniang even more.

Qin Erniang stared at her eagerly, “Yes, yes, that’s how we do it! You really know a lot! Can you make that?”

“It’s not good to eat such heavy food in the morning, how about you come for lunch, and I’ll make it for you? I stayed in Qianzhou for several months and learned to make some of their local dishes,” Lin Dan replied with a smile.

Qin Erniang nodded eagerly and then apologized, “Little boss, I was wrong yesterday. With your skills, you could make a profit even if your shop was in a corner!”

Lin Dan shook her head with a smile, her expression very gentle. Hearing their conversation, a customer came over and asked, “Boss, do you make rice noodles? People from our place usually eat rice noodles for breakfast, not noodles.”

Lin Dan nodded in realization and quickly responded, “I remember now! Of course, I make rice noodles, I just forgot. If you come tomorrow, you can have rice noodles, and by the way, I also make rice tofu. It’s especially delicious when mixed with spicy garlic sauce.”

The customers were delighted and promised to return tomorrow, not just tomorrow, but every day. They had never met a chef whose skills were so impressive. It seemed like there was no dish she couldn’t make, from every corner of the world.

Seeing that Qin Erniang and the others were getting home-style dishes, the other customers couldn’t sit still and rushed to Lin Dan’s side to order. Their eyes were full of hope. Fortunately, Lin Dan was experienced and could make most dishes. For the ones she hadn’t made before, she could figure out the flavor with detailed descriptions from the customers.

The atmosphere in the shop was lively. As soon as people started talking about home-style food, they couldn’t stop. Lin Dan listened with a smile, her expression calm and content.

Tang Jiu had already eaten his fill but sat in his chair, reluctant to leave. He enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this little restaurant, warm like home, just like the feeling Lin Dan gave him.


Just at that moment, a group of people walked in from outside, each of them having a fierce, intimidating look on their faces. They pushed past Xiao Zhu and the two waiters, shouting loudly, "Where is your boss? Bring them out! All the people who open shops in this area have to go through our Big Circle Gang and pay respect. Don't you know this rule?" It was obvious they were here to collect protection money.

In Nancheng, Tang Jiu was familiar with most of the major forces and could handle them easily, but he'd never even heard of the Big Circle Gang. As the saying goes, "The King of Hell is easy to meet, but the little devils are troublesome," and these people were probably those little devils—small-time thugs who prey on ordinary folks with no backing.

Just as Tang Jiu was about to step forward, Qin Erniang slammed her bowl down with a thud and shouted, "Who are these lowlifes? How dare they make a fuss in my territory? Be careful, I'll cut your tongues out!"

The gangsters didn't recognize Qin Erniang, so they assumed she was just a loud woman trying to make a scene. They raised their fists and were ready to fight. A few of the men threw their chopsticks down and went to join the scuffle, preparing for a brawl. Just as a fierce battle seemed about to break out, another group of people walked in. The leader was a tall, slim man, about eight feet in height, with exceptionally handsome features. He wore luxurious clothes, clearly not an ordinary person. His lips were pale, but his cheeks had an unusual flush, and his clear eyes seemed slightly intoxicated, making him appear both charming and elegant.

"Who are these annoying flies buzzing around? Move aside, all of you!" He casually waved his hand, and a few guards with swords stepped forward, pushing the thugs aside.

The noisy front hall suddenly fell silent. Everyone exchanged glances, knowing that this person must be an incredibly wealthy and important figure—after all, he had bodyguards with him, which meant he must be someone at least as important as a general.

"Please, everyone, sit down and continue eating. Don't mind me," the handsome man said with a polite smile, then turned to look at Lin Dan, hesitating before speaking, "You must be the manager, Lin?"

"Yes, that's me," Lin Dan replied, politely cupping her hands in greeting.

"Do you still have any of the Thousand Day Wine? I’d like to buy a few jars. No, no, not just a few, I’ll take every jar you have, all of it," the man said. As soon as he spoke, Lin Dan figured out his identity. He referred to himself as "This Lord," appeared slightly drunk, and was out this early with a group of bodyguards to buy wine. This man was likely the notorious, wine-obsessed Wei Yuanhou.

The reason Wei Yuanhou had come here suddenly started two days ago. That day, a bearded general had sent a jar of Thousand Day Wine, which had been put away by the housekeeper in the mansion. One day, when Wei Yuanhou was in the mood, he decided to show some guests his wine cellar and ordered his servant to bring down the best jar of wine from the shelf to share with his guests. However, when the servant was coming down the ladder, he bumped it, and the lightest jar, the Thousand Day Wine, fell and shattered on the floor.

Although the wine didn’t have a label and wasn’t packaged extravagantly, Wei Yuanhou didn’t mind at first, but when the rich fragrance of the wine filled the air, it covered up the scent of all the other wines in the cellar. The most moderate drinker turned red-faced without even tasting it, and Wei Yuanhou, who could drink a thousand cups without getting drunk, was immediately so intoxicated that he was lost in a daze.

"What kind of wine is this?" He didn't care that it had spilled on the dirty floor, scooping up a bit with his finger and tasting it. His eyes immediately lit up. "Good wine, truly the best I’ve ever had!" But just as he said this, he realized what had happened and quickly tried to absorb the spilled wine with a cloth. Unfortunately, the wine cellar had wooden floors and underfloor heating, so the wine quickly seeped through the gaps in the wood, and they couldn’t find any trace of it.

The best wine had been right in front of him, but he didn’t notice it until it was too late. How could Wei Yuanhou accept such a cruel reality? He immediately lost interest in entertaining his guests, ordered the rough servant to get twenty lashes, and then instructed the housekeeper to find the person who had offered the wine. After two days, they finally found Lin Dan. Unable to wait for daylight, he came himself with his guards.

Lin Dan, unaware of the complications, could tell from the urgency on Wei Yuanhou's face that he was desperate. She carefully observed him for a moment, then shook her head. "I don’t have any Thousand Day Wine. And even if I did, I wouldn’t sell it to you."

Chapter 24: The Cook 23

The Duke of Wei Yuan, nearly forty years old, appeared much younger, looking only in his early thirties due to his exceptional martial arts skills and well-maintained health. He was slender, with an air of nobility, and his demeanor was full of the refined charm of a scholar, completely devoid of the crudeness one might expect from a military officer.

However, when he raised an eyebrow and his gaze turned cold, a commanding aura would emanate from him, making others feel a sudden chill down their spine. Qin Erniang trembled in fear and quickly tugged at Lin Dan's sleeve, whispering, "Little Boss, don't argue with him! He's the Duke of Wei Yuan, a ruthless killer!"

Lin Dan, of course, knew that this man was the Duke of Wei Yuan, but she only slightly lifted her chin and met his gaze, maintaining a calm smile at the corner of her lips.

Tang Jiu stepped forward and positioned himself between the two, cupping his hands toward the Duke and saying, "Your Grace, the shop does not have any Thousand-Day Wine."

"Tang Shizi, you’ve returned from the north?" The Duke of Wei Yuan glanced at him casually, his gentle voice masking an underlying firmness. "Hu Feng told me the wine was brewed by her, but if it's not available, I can wait. If you have it but refuse to sell, what is the meaning of this?"

"Tang Shizi?" Lin Dan, ignoring the Duke’s interrogation, stepped forward to carefully scrutinize Tang Jiu, her expression one of realization. "You’re the Young Duke?" She should have figured it out—his surname was Tang and he was ranked ninth. She should have known he was Tang Cheng, the son of the Duke of Yongding. She couldn’t help but wonder what he had gone through in the past few years, as he had gone from being a handsome youth with the appearance of a delicate flower to the robust, muscular man before her. His facial features were still handsome, but they now carried a strong masculine air, and the scar on his brow only added to his fierce demeanor. His tightly fitted clothes could not conceal the strength in his muscles, and compared to the graceful young man from before, it was like looking at a completely different person.

Even someone as indifferent as Lin Dan might not have recognized him, and if the original owner, who had once deeply loved the young duke, were here, she probably wouldn’t have recognized him either.

Tang Jiu stiffened, hastily explaining, "Lin Dan, listen to me, I had planned to tell you earlier…"

Before he could finish, Lin Dan smiled, not a false smile of graciousness, nor the bitter smile of being deceived, but one of genuine joy at meeting an old acquaintance. "Young Duke, it’s been years! I hope you’ve been well. How is the Old Duke’s health?"

Tang Jiu was suddenly at a loss for words and muttered, "He’s well, we are all well." Lin Dan didn't seem angry, and he should have been relieved, but why did he feel a sense of disappointment?

"I’m not here to listen to you two catch up," the Duke of Wei Yuan's voice, which had been soft, was now completely replaced by coldness. His attendants all placed their hands on their sword hilts, as if ready to draw them at any moment.

The group blocked the doorway, and the customers in the shop were too scared to run, too scared to stay, all pale with fear.

Yet, Lin Dan remained calm as ever, cupping her hands and saying, "Your Grace, have you ever heard of ‘Péngyá’ (Pungya)?"

"The ‘Shi Zi’ says: 'The land of the Red County, the place of Kunlun, is where the salt floats to form Pungya. Red grass grows on top, and one can drink it and be drunk for three years.'" The Duke of Wei Yuan’s expression was somewhat surprised. He had thought this was merely a legend.

"Thousand-Day Wine can make one drink once and become intoxicated for three years. What kind of ingredient is used to make a wine so strong? Following this clue, I eventually found Pungya, and that’s how I was able to restore the recipe from centuries ago. But Your Grace, do you know that Pungya only floats once a year, and it produces one hundred fruits at a time, with a thousand fruits needed to brew one jar of wine? I spent three years just to obtain one jar, but it was destroyed by bandits. Now, where can I get another jar for you?" Lin Dan continued, "That was just part of the story. There’s another part."

"Your Grace, you came back to the capital to recover your health. But do you know what illness you have?" Lin Dan analyzed, her gaze sharp. "I see your lips are pale, your eyes are red, and you’re easily irritated—these are all signs of liver damage. And alcohol, especially strong drinks, is a toxin that harms the liver. If I sell you such a strong wine, your condition will only worsen. Who will be responsible for that?"

Lin Dan continued gently, "For the sake of your health, I cannot sell you this wine. I hope you understand."

"Ha! In the end, it’s my fault?" The Duke of Wei Yuan twisted his ring, his expression hardening slightly. His head attendant rushed forward and whispered, "Your Grace, the Imperial Physician has repeatedly warned you to avoid excessive drinking. Please listen to him. This Thousand-Day Wine is too harmful to your body. Would it be alright if we don’t buy it?"

Just a moment ago, the attendants had looked ready to smash the shop, but now they had softened. They were clearly more concerned about the Duke’s health and hoped to accompany him back to the southeast once he recovered.

"Fine, no wine," The Duke of Wei Yuan understood that his subordinates were looking out for him, but he was still disappointed to leave without what he came for. He couldn’t help but chuckle coldly, "Then I’ll just have a meal here. I heard your waiter say you can cook anything and satisfy your customers? Fine, I’ll order a table of dishes made with wine. Can you do that? If you don’t impress me, I’ll destroy your shop."

At this point, the Duke of Wei Yuan, who had appeared so refined and charming earlier, finally showed his brutish side, the rough and domineering nature typical of military commanders.

"Will I be satisfied just because of your words?" Tang Jiu frowned, about to step forward to argue. Others might be afraid of the Duke, but not him.

Lin Dan held him back and nodded, "Of course I can."

"The little girl’s too proud for her own good, agreeing so easily without even listening to my request." The Duke of Wei Yuan continued, "Don’t think that just pouring a bit of wine to give the ingredients a hint of wine flavor is enough to make a dish. What I mean is, make a dish with the wine itself, so that when you take a bite, it’s filled with wine but doesn’t damage the liver. Can you do that?"

The moment he made this request, the entire restaurant was in an uproar. Wine in cooking is usually only used as a seasoning; no one had ever heard of using it as the main ingredient for a dish. After all, it was wine, not water. If you put it in a pot, you might just heat it up a little and pour it out. No chef had ever turned wine into an actual dish. Moreover, how would you balance all the flavors—sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty—into the wine, so that it could be both delicious and fulfilling while still satisfying the appetite?

The Duke of Wei Yuan was clearly trying to make trouble!

Tang Jiu glared and said word by word, "Your Grace, you’re making things difficult. If you’re so bored, why don’t you go home and drink some medicine to nourish your body?"

"Little brat, when did my business become something for you to meddle with?" Wei Yuan Hou sneered repeatedly.

Lin Dan, however, calmly tied her headscarf and said slowly, "Making dishes with alcohol? Fine, Your Lordship, please wait a moment." With that, she motioned for the nervous and uneasy Xiao Zhu to bring out a jar she had been keeping.

When Wei Yuan Hou saw the tightly sealed jar, he couldn’t help but laugh smugly. "You still say there's no alcohol? Didn't you just bring it out? Let me tell you, if the alcohol you give me doesn't match the quality of the Thousand-Day Wine, I'll still smash your shop. No begging will help." He was certain Lin Dan couldn’t possibly use alcohol to cook, so he was already preparing to concede.

But Lin Dan simply smiled lightly, cracked open the clay seal on the jar, and carefully scooped out something with a slotted spoon. Everyone looked on in surprise. What they saw was a half-arm long, elongated object, crystal clear and green like jade. When placed on the cutting board, it even bounced a little, soft and tender, almost resembling a type of food. Not only did it look beautiful, but it also emitted a strong fragrance. As soon as it was revealed, it completely overpowered the scent of the rich marinade, making its presence domineering.

Even Wei Yuan Hou, who had seen countless wines, couldn’t immediately identify it. He asked in curiosity, "What is this?" He swallowed quietly, then sniffed the air. It was fragrant—this thing smelled really damn good, almost on par with the Thousand-Day Wine.

"This type of wine is brewed using a method I learned in Yanglin County, with dozens of herbs like codonopsis, jujube, dried tangerine peel, and cloves. The wine is fragrant and rich, with health benefits. Even if you drink a hundred jars, it won’t get you drunk. Its characteristics are the complete opposite of Thousand-Day Wine," Lin Dan explained. "The name of this wine is Yanglin Fei. The reason it’s called 'Fei' is because it contains a special ingredient—fatty meat."

Brewing wine with fatty meat—this was something no one had ever heard of before! The crowd couldn’t help but gasp, but when they saw the jade-green item on the cutting board, they couldn’t help but believe it.

Wei Yuan Hou's eyes widened, his earlier displeasure completely replaced by curiosity. He loved wine and was particularly interested in hearing stories about brewing, especially since Lin Dan seemed to know so much about various types of wines, which only piqued his interest more. He suddenly realized he had misjudged this little girl. She wasn’t arrogant due to ignorance; she was simply confident because she had a wealth of knowledge.

Lin Dan carefully cut the translucent, jade-like meat into thin slices and continued, "This jar of wine has just been sealed for three months, so it’s not fully brewed yet, but the meat has already absorbed the wine and become crystal clear. It’s like ice jade. Don’t be surprised—there’s a similar brewing method in the Baiyue region called Jade Ice Brew, named after this very technique."

She placed the cut meat in a bowl, added two spoonfuls of aromatic marinade, and gently mixed it by hand. Then, she took the fermented rice that had been soaking for a day, crushed it into glutinous rice fragments, mixed it with soy sauce, pepper, five-spice powder, and set it aside.

Once everything was ready, she mixed the marinated jade meat into the rice crumbs, placed it in a steamer for fifteen minutes, then plated it. Finally, she gently sprinkled some ginger and green onions over it, and asked Xiao Zhu to fetch her pickled vegetable jar. She placed some bean sprouts in small dishes, drizzled them with a drop of sesame oil for garnish.

"Your Lordship, please enjoy," Lin Dan gently placed the dish on the table. A couple of dull thuds followed, and only then did Wei Yuan Hou snap back to reality, staring at her with wide eyes, filled with astonishment.

Lin Dan softly explained, "This dish is called 'Wine-Marinated Steamed Pork'. Though it's made with wine ingredients, it won’t harm your liver. Instead, it helps strengthen your spleen, moistens your lungs, and enhances heart muscle function. It's very good for your health. This dish is called 'Liao Zao Green Bean Sprouts'. It nourishes the liver, calms the nerves, clears the gallbladder, and detoxifies alcohol. Please try it, Your Lordship. If it doesn't meet your expectations, you can smash the shop, and I won’t say another word."

Having suffered from liver damage and a lack of appetite for a long time, Wei Yuan Hou instinctively picked up his chopsticks.
