Chapter 21: The Cook 20

Tang Jiu stretched his neck as far as he could to look into the clay pot, but Lin Dan pushed him away and teased, "Take it easy, don't fall in, or I'll braise you along with it."

Tang Jiu burst into laughter, his eyes shining as he gazed at her. "The soup you make is completely different from others'."

Lin Dan spoke calmly, "The Lüshi Chunqiu’s Ben Wei chapter states: 'Among all flavors, water is the foundation. With the five flavors, three ingredients, and nine boils and transformations… the ultimate taste is achieved.' These three pots of soup are made with sweet, clear mountain spring water, infused with secret spices, and cooked over fragrant pinewood. Each time it boils, I add an ingredient, repeating the process nine times to enhance the flavor layer by layer, until it reaches perfection. Flavors can be salty or sweet, aromas strong or mild. My braising broth is made using my own ‘Unique Aroma Flavor Enhancement Method,’ making it far richer than ordinary ones."

As she spoke, Lin Dan placed the braised chicken, duck, and pork knuckle into a food box. Then, she sliced the large pieces of pork belly and prepared a dipping sauce before continuing, "Aged braising broth is always the best, so fresh ingredients must be added continuously. Take these cooked dishes home and enjoy them at your leisure—it’s my way of thanking you for looking after me these past days."

"No need to thank me," Tang Jiu said politely, but his hands honestly reached out to take the food box. Then, he asked, "I remember you also put pig skin in there earlier. Where is it?" He particularly loved braised pig skin and couldn't help asking.

Lin Dan pointed at the pork knuckle and belly, chuckling, "See these? They’ve been deep-fried, so their crispy outer layer protects the tender meat inside, preventing them from falling apart in the broth. But the pig skin was fresh and unfried. After several hours, it has melted into a thick gelatin and blended into the broth. Good braising broth should be both fragrant and sticky. And where does that richness come from? From the fats and gelatin. Without melting the pig skin, how could I make a new broth taste like an aged one? If you like, next time I can fry the pig skin first before braising it, then let it cool for you to pick up."

Lin Dan spoke about food as if reciting a scripture, effortlessly revealing secrets that others might take a lifetime to learn. Tang Jiu listened, completely captivated. Swallowing hard, he emphasized, "Make sure to braise extra pig skin next time—I’ll come back for it. If you run into any trouble, go to the Ministry of War and find me. I’m stationed there."

Lin Dan neither questioned Tang Jiu’s identity nor showed any nervousness about befriending an influential figure. She simply smiled and nodded, seeing him off.

To her surprise, Tang Jiu seemed slightly disappointed that she didn't ask more. Even as he walked far away, he kept turning back with a complicated expression.

At the alley entrance, he saw a few men rushing out of a gambling house, shouting, "That amazing smell is gone! Who the hell was cooking? It’s too damn tempting! Forget gambling—let’s go home and eat!"

Moments later, the entire alley came alive with people opening their doors, sniffing the air and looking around with greedy expressions. The incredible aroma of the braised broth was truly extraordinary.

Tang Jiu chuckled as he carried his food box away, shaking his head. Behind him, whispers filled the street—

"Who was braising meat just now? Did you smell that? It was incredible!"

Upon entering the government office, Tang Jiu immediately noticed Zhao Liu and Luo Tietou gathered around, eating something with a faintly sweet fragrance. The aroma was enticing. Zhao Liu raised his chopsticks and greeted him, "Hey, Boss, you’re finally here! We’re already eating."

"You accepted another food box from Yan Langqing?" Tang Jiu’s pleased expression darkened. "How many times have I told you—no matter what she says, don’t let her in, and don’t accept her food! Are you all ignoring me?"

A delicate food box sat on his desk, its lid already open. Inside, four exquisite dishes—both meat and vegetable—were plated in fine, white porcelain bowls. Zhao Liu and the others had also received a box, though theirs contained more food but lacked the refined presentation, clearly meant to bribe them.

As the saying goes, "A favor received is a debt owed." Having frequently enjoyed Yan Langqing’s gifts, Zhao Liu and the others naturally spoke on her behalf.

"Boss, you should just marry Chef Yan already. You love good food, and you’re picky. If you don’t marry a top imperial chef like her, who else could possibly satisfy you? Even the Noble Consort has approved the match! We’d be lucky to marry someone like her—her cooking is incredible! You won’t find another wife like her even if you searched with a lantern. Stop being so stubborn and just propose already!"

Tang Jiu stared at the ornate food box for a long while before letting out a cold laugh. "You can have this food box. From now on, if she sends anything, eat it yourselves—I won’t stop you."

The men beamed, thrilled at the prospect, but then their leader added, "But from now on, none of you will get a share of my food."

The so-called “leader’s food” was undoubtedly prepared by the marquis' top chefs. But how could that compare to the Imperial Kitchen’s head chef? Without hesitation, the men grinned and agreed, "Alright, alright! From now on, we’ll handle Chef Yan’s food for you!" They quickly grabbed the food box from Tang Jiu’s desk.

"Good, it’s settled." Tang Jiu bent down, pulled out a jar of fine liquor, popped the seal, and poured himself a drink. Then, he opened Lin Dan’s food box, unveiling a steaming braised chicken. Lifting the next layer, he found a braised duck, then a braised pork knuckle, and finally, thinly sliced braised pork belly. Each piece was garnished with sesame seeds and chopped scallions, accompanied by a small dish of vibrant red garlic chili sauce. A powerful aroma instantly filled the room.

Tang Jiu casually picked up a chicken claw and gently pulled—instantly, the entire leg separated, its tender meat and silky skin glistening with flavorful juices. A bite revealed a rich, savory taste. The pork knuckle had been simmered to perfection—its skin burst with a gentle suck, the meat melted in his mouth, and the tendons retained just the right amount of chewiness. The pork belly, evenly marbled with fat and lean meat, carried a deep umami richness. A few chews blended the fatty juices with the tender texture, enhanced by the pungent garlic and fiery chili—a truly divine combination.

He devoured several bites, then, seemingly choked, quickly took a swig of strong liquor, sighing in satisfaction.

The room was unusually silent. When he looked up, he found Zhao Liu and the others frozen in place, their eyes practically glowing green as they stared at his food box.

"Get lost," he sneered.

"But Boss! Where did you buy that braised meat? It smells too damn good! Just give us one bite!" Zhao Liu shamelessly pleaded.

The dishes Yan Langqing sent were served in dainty porcelain plates, their flavors mild and delicate, and the portions minuscule—one bite was enough to finish an entire dish. They were delicious, but unsatisfying. In contrast, Tang Jiu’s food was bold, rich, and meaty—real food for real men! Tearing off a whole chicken leg, stuffing it into his mouth, and washing it down with burning liquor—that was the kind of meal that could send a man straight to heaven!

"Boss! Please, just one bite! We swear, from now on, we’ll never touch Chef Yan’s food again!" Zhao Liu and the others surrounded him, practically drooling into his dishes.

"Get lost!" Tang Jiu repeated, finishing his meal before having the leftovers sent home for a late-night snack.

Zhao Liu and the others clutched their chests in agony, swearing never to accept Yan Langqing’s food again. That aroma was too overpowering—it had stolen their very souls.

Ignoring them, Tang Jiu left for the military camp.

Good food was meant to be savored alone—why would he share?

……

Lin Dan had a dreamless night. The next morning, she got up early, first kneading the dough and letting it rest under a damp cloth. Then, she cooked porridge and prepared the ingredients, getting ready to welcome customers. Most of the servants who had accompanied her back to the capital had already left, leaving only Xiao Zhu and two literate waiters. Meanwhile, Peony and Azalea were in charge of helping in the kitchen.

"We're only selling noodles and porridge?" Peony asked curiously, noticing that her master hadn't prepared any other ingredients.

"In the morning, people should eat lightly. A bowl of porridge or noodles is enough. Besides, those who wake up before dawn are usually hardworking commoners rushing off to work. They don’t have much money to spare, so ordering a simple bowl of plain porridge or Yangchun noodles is already a luxury for them. We’ll serve only noodles and porridge in the morning, offer a full menu at noon with rice, noodles, and vegetables, and then close early in the afternoon. We won’t do business in the evening because there are several brothels and gambling houses nearby, making things quite chaotic later in the day," Lin Dan patiently explained.

A nearby dock frequently received merchant ships, and several escort agencies had been set up to facilitate the transport of goods. With an increasing number of merchants traveling north and south, brothels, gambling houses, and inns naturally flourished, gradually forming a unique business district. Those who woke up early were either dockworkers, boatmen, or bodyguards—none of whom were wealthy. But by noon, a diverse crowd would emerge: the rich and the poor, those from the underworld and the authorities, government officials or wealthy merchants traveling by water. This place was a true mix of people from all walks of life.

Opening a restaurant in such a bustling area satisfied Lin Dan greatly. She couldn’t understand why the Yan family thought she would suffer a huge loss.

Smiling, Lin Dan shook her head. As dawn approached, the sound of footsteps rustled through the street. She instructed Xiao Zhu and the two waiters to carry the large earthen pot of braised broth outside and place it at the entrance, setting up a few stoves beneath it to let it simmer gently over a low flame.

"Remove the cloth strips, lift the lid, and give it a good stir with the long ladle," she called out.

Xiao Zhu followed her instructions. But as soon as he lifted the lid, an intense wave of fragrance rushed out, making his head spin. His mouth watered instantly, and he nearly drooled into the broth. Hastily covering his mouth, he turned away and handed the ladle to another waiter, gulping, "You stir it—I haven’t even had breakfast yet!"

"I haven’t eaten either!" The waiter quickly swallowed his saliva before stirring.

The moment he stirred the broth, the already rich aroma intensified, spreading rapidly in all directions. The scent drifted through the alleyways, markets, and docks, filling the entire area in an instant. Those nearby found themselves restless, unable to sit still as the irresistible fragrance teased their senses.

Chapter 22: The Cook 21

Lin Dan did not stay in the kitchen but instead had the shop assistant set up a simple stall at the entrance of the restaurant. Inside the stall, she arranged a stove, pots, bowls, a chopping board, knives, and other utensils. She then washed her hands and face, using a cloth to completely gather and tie up her long hair to prevent any strands from falling into the food.

After stirring the braising sauce, Xiao Zhu pitifully pleaded, "Sister Lin, can you cook us a bowl of noodles? We’ll work better on a full stomach!"

Lin Dan cast him a sideways glance with a smile, then cut a piece from the rested dough, quickly pulling it into thin, silken noodles before placing them into the boiling spring water. She lined up five large bowls and ladled in a scoop of creamy-white bone broth for each. Once the noodles were cooked, she thinly sliced some braised meat and arranged the pieces neatly on top. She added a few cooked leafy greens, placed half a braised egg into the soup, and finally sprinkled chopped scallions and cilantro on top.

"Eat up, and get to work once you're done," Lin Dan said. The moment she finished speaking, Xiao Zhu and the others cheered, each grabbing a bowl and slurping up their noodles eagerly.

"Master, the noodles are so springy! The rich aroma of the braised meat blends perfectly with the fresh flavor of the bone broth—it's just the right balance, neither too salty nor too bland. Can I have another bowl?" Shaoyao praised while eating.

"Sure, I'll make another one. You and Dujuan can share," Lin Dan agreed. Since the kids were still growing, their appetites were naturally large, and she had no problem providing them with extra food. She turned around to continue pulling the noodles when Xiao Zhu curiously asked, "Boss, why did you move the kitchen outside? It seems inconvenient with all the people passing by!"

"It's actually for convenience that I moved it outside. Customers can tell me their preferred noodle style and portion size as soon as they enter, and I can prepare it right away. Freshly boiled noodles taste the best—smooth, chewy, and distinct. If they sit for even a moment, they clump together, affecting the texture. At noon, when we cook stir-fried dishes, the oil smoke would be too strong and might choke the customers, so we'll move everything back inside then," Lin Dan explained. She always pursued perfection in her culinary skills, prioritizing the dining experience, and arranged everything in the most customer-friendly way.

Xiao Zhu and the others nodded in understanding. Just then, a deep voice sounded from outside the door. "Lin Dan, being your customer must be one of the greatest joys in the world."

"You’re here again," Lin Dan said with a smile, shaking her head. "You're too kind. What kind of noodles would you like? I'll make them for you."

"I'm not picky. Just cook whatever you see fit," Tang Jiu said as he stepped through the door. Xiao Zhu and the others quickly greeted him and wiped down a table and chair for him.

Knowing that Tang Jiu was a true foodie who enjoyed all kinds of flavors, Lin Dan prepared him a bowl of braised noodle soup. After serving her first customer, she began preparing the minced topping. She retrieved a well-braised piece of pork belly from the sauce pot and finely diced it. Tossing it into another pan, she added dry wood as fuel and stir-fried it over high heat until fragrant. Then she gradually added diced tofu, bamboo shoots, and water bamboo, pouring in some clear broth to simmer everything into a rich, savory sauce.

"That smells amazing! Can I have some of that on my noodles?" Tang Jiu asked eagerly.

"Of course. Adding a scoop of topping costs one more copper coin," Lin Dan teased.

"I’d pay five more if needed," Tang Jiu replied, giving her a deep look. He mixed the topping into his noodles and took a big bite. His eyes instantly lit up. Using just half a pound of braised meat, Lin Dan had managed to infuse a whole pot of vegetables with a strong, meaty aroma—her cooking skills were truly remarkable.

Seeing his surprise, Lin Dan explained, "Most early-morning laborers aren’t wealthy and only get to eat meat during holidays. My braised meat noodles cost four coins a bowl, which some people might not afford. So, instead of serving pure meat, I use one piece of braised pork to make a pot of vegetable topping with a rich meat flavor. This way, more people can enjoy the taste of meat at a lower cost. Tofu, bamboo shoots, and water bamboo are all soft and absorbent ingredients. When simmered in the braising sauce, they take on the taste of the meat. This technique is called 'flavor infusion' in seasoning."

Unconsciously, Tang Jiu put down his bowl, listening intently as if entranced.

Meanwhile, the enticing aroma had already drawn many people to the area. They followed the scent, figuring that a nearby restaurant must be preparing breakfast for sale. Though most of them couldn't afford braised meat, they could at least get a bowl of plain noodles. The cook who could make such a fragrant braised dish surely had great culinary skills.

With this in mind, many people turned into the narrow alley. Even those who initially took a wrong turn quickly found their way by following the scent. Soon, a crowd gathered at the entrance of the restaurant. Their mouths watered as they saw the steaming pot of braising sauce, their hunger stirred by the sight of Tang Jiu happily slurping down his noodles, his face full of satisfaction.

"Boss, how much for a bowl of noodles?" a burly man asked, swallowing his saliva.

"Plain noodles, one coin. Minced topping noodles, two coins. Extra topping noodles, three coins. Braised meat noodles, four coins. I also sell plain congee for two coins," Lin Dan calmly stated.

Xiao Zhu and the others immediately stepped forward to warmly welcome the customers. "Dear guests, please come in if you'd like to eat!"

"The minced topping noodles are only two coins? This topping?" The burly man pointed at the large pot, his eyes sparkling. The braised meat had completely melted into the sauce, and the diced bamboo shoots, tofu, and water bamboo had absorbed its rich, dark color, looking just like pure braised meat. They also carried the same rich aroma, with an added hint of natural sweetness that meat alone lacked.

The man, not knowing the secret behind the dish, assumed that the minced topping was made purely of braised meat and was shocked. A bowl of meat-based topping noodles like this would cost at least five coins elsewhere.

"That's right, only two coins. My topping is made from vegetables, so there’s no waste," Lin Dan patiently explained.

"Then give me a bowl!" The man didn't hesitate anymore and stepped inside, secretly delighted. Who cares if it’s made of vegetables? As long as it tastes like meat, that’s all that matters.

He seemed to be the leader of a group, and as soon as he went in, the others followed, each ordering a bowl of minced topping noodles. Judging by their accents, they were all from the same place.

Lin Dan said softly, "Judging by your accents, you all seem to be from northern Shaanxi. How about I adjust the minced meat sauce to match your hometown flavor?"

"You can adjust the minced meat sauce flavor? That’s great!" The group nodded eagerly.

Lin Dan placed a pot on the vacant stove, poured in some oil, and waited until it heated to about 70% before adding chili powder to create a vibrant red oil. Since there were nine customers, she scooped out nine portions of minced meat sauce and stir-fried them briefly with the red oil. She then thickened the mixture with starch and, once the sauce was boiling, added finely chopped pickled cabbage to cook together with the minced meat. In this way, the originally savory minced meat sauce was transformed into a bright red, fiery, tangy, and salty Shaanxi-style sauce.

Once the sauce was ready, the noodles had also finished cooking. Lin Dan quickly scooped them into nine bowls, sprinkled them with minced ginger, scallions, and cilantro, and had Xiao Zhu and the others serve them.

The group of burly men had initially come just to try something new, but the moment they saw this familiar bowl of hometown noodles, their expressions turned emotional. They eagerly picked up their chopsticks, and after just one bite, their eyes glistened with unshed tears. The noodles were thin yet chewy, the sauce was both sour and spicy—just the right intensity. As the hot, flavorful food warmed their stomachs, long-buried memories of their hometown and childhood, things they didn’t even dare to think about on lonely nights, surfaced all at once. The nostalgia it evoked was powerful, yet at the same time, it soothed their homesickness.

"This is delicious! It tastes just like what I had as a child!" One of the men wolfed down a few more bites before speaking again, his voice slightly hoarse. His companions nodded repeatedly, looking deeply satisfied. After eating a bowl of these hometown noodles, they felt reinvigorated, ready to carry more cargo and earn more money.

"This is so good—I’m coming back tomorrow," one of them said, unable to part with his meal even before finishing it. The once monotonous and grueling life suddenly felt like it held something to look forward to.

"I’ll come too," the others chimed in. After all, nothing could beat the comfort of hometown food.

Soon, a few more people arrived at the shop. They were slightly shorter in stature and spoke with a thick accent that was difficult for most to understand. However, Lin Dan had traveled extensively and had a broad knowledge of different dialects, so she had no trouble communicating with them. She patiently explained the prices of the noodles and porridge.

After hesitating for a moment and staring at the pot of sauce, they finally gave in to temptation and stepped inside.

"Judging by your accents, you gentlemen must be from Baiyue. How about I adjust the minced meat sauce to suit your regional taste?" Lin Dan asked politely.

They exchanged skeptical glances but gave slight nods.

Lin Dan scooped out a few portions of minced meat sauce, diluted the intensity with water, and added some sugar. Then, she took a small jar from the stove and ladled out a few spoonfuls of a dark, murky sauce, mixing it into the prepared minced meat sauce. A pungent, briny aroma filled the air, which, once combined with the rich, savory fragrance of the minced meat sauce, became irresistibly fresh and appetizing, carrying a hint of the sea.

The skeptical expressions on the men’s faces were instantly replaced by surprise and delight. They chattered excitedly in their dialect, raising their thumbs in approval.

Lin Dan nodded and said, "That’s right, this is sand crab sauce. I made it myself—give it a try and see if it’s authentic."

People from Baiyue, especially those from the western regions, had a deep love for sand crab sauce. They used it in both meat and vegetable dishes and even incorporated it into noodle sauces, mixing it with sweet bean paste and fermented soybean paste. Lin Dan had spent a few months in Xiyue before, so she was well-versed in making authentic Xiyue-style minced meat noodles, known for their distinctive briny freshness.

With the sauce prepared, Lin Dan filled the bowls with noodles and ladled over a thick, milky broth. She then sprinkled pink shrimp skins and finely chopped green onions on top, making the dish look incredibly appetizing.

The men didn’t wait for Xiao Zhu and the others to serve them. Instead, they stood at the entrance, watching Lin Dan cook. As soon as the noodles were ready, they eagerly picked up their own bowls and started eating right away. No matter how many different cuisines they had tried, nothing could ever compare to the taste of home.

As the rich aroma continued to spread, more and more customers arrived. Lin Dan adjusted the flavors according to their preferences—adding Sichuan peppercorns and fermented broad bean paste for customers from Shu to create a numbing-spicy taste, making it fragrant-spicy for people from Hunan, and preparing other variations such as sour-spicy, scallion-infused, or even dry-mixed and oil-splashed noodles for those who preferred less broth.

It was often said that it was impossible to satisfy everyone’s tastes, yet in her hands, it seemed like the easiest thing in the world.
