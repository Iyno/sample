Chapter 31: The Second Generation of Heroes (6)

As for these matters, Yuan Qingning, who was busy in the entertainment industry, focusing on becoming a dazzling, attention-grabbing superstar, naturally knew nothing about them. It wasn’t like she hadn’t been out recently; during this period, she often visited Yuan Rong’s company, bringing him snacks and fruits, which led to some rumors. The public didn’t know that Yuan Qingning was adopted by General Yuan, but because they were aware of Guo Rong Technology’s impressive background, they didn’t dare to name names, only speculating that Yuan Qingning might be in a relationship with a high-ranking official from the company.

Yuan Qingning found this rather amusing and blushed with a shy smile, her eyes sparkling. "Rong Ge, I'm sorry, it's all my fault."

"It’s fine, there are so many high-ranking officials, who knows who they’re talking about." Yuan Rong glanced at her and said.

"Mm."

"You’ve been coming here often lately. Did you have a fight with Yuan Yao?" Yuan Rong asked. She had always been closer to Yuan Yao, so he was puzzled by her sudden frequent visits to him.

"No, it’s just that Brother Yao went back to school, and he's in a military academy. I don’t want to disturb him."

"Is that so?" Although it was a closed-off military school, with their family’s power, it would only take a few words to find someone there. She had often visited Yuan Yao before, so why say this now?

Yuan Rong’s eyes were always calm, but there was a quiet sharpness to them, as if he could see through certain matters and people without saying a word. It was hard to tell what he was thinking. Yuan Qingning felt a little nervous under his gaze and quickly added, "This year, isn’t there the National Youth Heroes Games? Brother Yao needs to train, and I don’t want to disturb him or waste his time."

The National Youth Heroes Games, officially known as the "National Junior Hero Sports Meet," was a biennial event where students from all schools participated in sports competitions to showcase their physical strength and war drills to display their wisdom.

Due to the threat of extraterrestrial invaders, humanity had seemingly fallen from the top of the food chain. People were filled with confusion about the future, and countless apocalyptic-themed films and TV shows emerged, expressing concerns about the planet's future. As a result, nations around the world placed great importance on soldiers who protected their homeland, evidenced by the increasing number of military schools being established. The excellence of the youth was the most reassuring thing to people. No matter how hopeless the current situation was, the outstanding young people growing up always gave a sense of hope. A strong youth meant a strong nation.

To maintain social stability and development, the National Youth Heroes Games emerged. This year marked the 13th edition.

Yuan Rong nodded, seemingly accepting this explanation.

Yuan Qingning stood up reluctantly. "Well, I’ll be going now, Rong Ge. Remember to eat the snacks and give me some feedback."

"Mm."

It was human nature to desire what one couldn’t have. Yuan Qingning believed Yuan Yao was already hers. She was satisfied with his looks and physique, but recalling that in the previous life, Yuan Rong had liked Xie Yingying and treated her so well, while in this life, he didn’t seem to like her, she couldn’t help but feel dissatisfied. But that was fine. She would get him eventually! If Xie Yingying could have what she wanted, so could she!

Thinking of this, after Yuan Qingning got in the car, she told the driver, "Take me to Qingyan High School."

In her previous life, she had suffered a lot at Qingyan High School, and she couldn’t help but want to go there as a glamorous superstar. Perhaps some of the people who had bullied her in the past had become her fans and were now begging for autographs. Just thinking about it made her feel delighted. Of course, the most important thing was that she wanted to see how miserable Xie Yingying looked now.

However, she didn’t get in because of the robot by An Cui’s side. Qingyan High School was now under a real lockdown, preventing anyone from entering or leaving to avoid leaking secrets.

Yuan Qingning had to return disappointed, but it didn’t matter. She thought to herself that even without entering, she could still imagine how wretched Xie Yingying was now.

...

In Yuan Qingning's mind, An Cui, who had been bullied to the point of feeling worse than death, was now dismantling the refrigerator in their class. Behind her, a few lackeys were crouching, handing her tools. In the hallway, many people were present, and because she was too big to fit through the door, An Dabao, who had been driven out of the class, squatted outside like a big dog, watching through the window.

"Stop touching me! I’ll accuse you of sexual harassment!" An Dabao argued with the girls who were touching her. It wasn’t that there weren’t boys who wanted to touch her, but since the girls' department was all girls, the boys couldn’t reach her.

"What's wrong with touching a little? Don’t be so petty. Ying Jie didn’t say we couldn’t touch. You don’t have the right to say no."

"Yeah, yeah."

"Do you even have a little brother? Where is he? Where is he?"

"Ah! Shameless! I want my beautiful and noble master!"

"Hahahaha..."

At that moment, outside the teaching building, a long ladder was extended, and a muscular boy climbed up aggressively.

"Go, Meng Ge, kill that woman!" His companions shouted in encouragement from below.

He quickly reached the fourth floor.

"Cao Meng!" A girl inside the classroom saw the boy suddenly appear outside the window and screamed in surprise.

Instantly, everyone in the class looked over and screamed.

Cao Meng stood on the windowsill, one hand pressing against the window frame, grinning at An Cui. "Hahaha, Xie Yingying, now your robot can’t get in the classroom. Let’s see what you do! I’ll settle both the old and new scores with you today!"

An Cui looked at the big, muscular boy, then glanced at the refrigerator door in her hand. She suddenly grabbed a piece and threw it at Cao Meng. Cao Meng raised his foot and stomped on it, grinning. "This time, without the robot to help you, let’s see how you’re going to show off!"

"Oh? Is that so?" An Cui smiled hypocritically.

Cao Meng looked down and saw that his ankle had somehow been caught by an iron ring. In that instant, An Cui suddenly lifted the refrigerator door, and Cao Meng, who had stepped on it, lost his balance and fell backward.

"Ah!!"

The girls watching this screamed. This was the fourth floor! What if he dies from the fall?!

For a moment, Cao Meng thought he was going to break his neck and die, but just before hitting the ground, the iron ring on his foot tightened, and he was bounced back, hanging between the first and second floors. He realized that the iron ring was connected to a long rope.

All the girls in the girls' department ran over to watch this scene, while the boys below stared at their leader, stunned.

The notorious school bully of Qingyan High School, Cao Meng, the youngest son of General Cao, who had been causing trouble for years, was now being hung upside down in the air, surrounded by all the girls and his own subordinates. It was like a public execution.

Cao Meng’s face turned from red to purple, then to ashen. He shouted at the girls, "Get lost, or I’ll make you regret it!" Then he shouted at his subordinates, "Damn it, why aren’t you coming to get me down?!"

"Splash!" As soon as he finished shouting, a bucket of cold water poured down on him, drenching him completely.

"..."

"..."

"..."

"Poof!"

"Poof!"

One by one, the suppressed laughs echoed.

Cao Meng: "Xie Yingying!!!!"

An Cui propped her elbow on the windowsill and rested her chin on her hand, throwing the water basin to the side to one of her lackeys, her face full of joy.

Cao Meng had developed a deep hatred for An Cui, and from that moment on, he was determined to challenge her every day. However, An Cui never played by the rules, always showing everyone how a clever mind was far stronger than powerful limbs.

In just a few days, Cao Meng experienced being publicly humiliated in various ways—hung upside down on the girls' department teaching building, then hung upside down on the girls' dormitory building, stripped naked and hung upside down on the girls' teaching building, and even hung from the flagpole—all of these public punishments that shattered his dignity and pride.

His lackeys couldn’t help but tremble and advised, "Boss, maybe we should just let it go..."

"How could I let it go?!" Cao Meng's face twisted with rage, gritting his teeth. "Just wait! Tomorrow's the practical exam, I’ll make sure to deal with her!"

"But boss, Xie Yingying is a second-year student, not in our grade, we can't..." one lackey started to say.

"Can't what? Just watch," Cao Meng spat out, still furious.

Normally, the boys' and girls' departments were taught separately, but sometimes they had joint classes, like the practical combat exam, where students would spar with each other. This exam was held once a month, and in Qingyan High School, students woke up at 5:30 AM for morning exercises, had classes until 10:00 PM, with lights out at 10:30, no internet, and no phone calls to the outside world. Besides the regular classes, there was also physical training, making it an incredibly tough school.

Qingyan High School had only about 500 students across the boys' and girls' departments. It was such a tough school that many parents found it hard to send their children there, especially with some students being juvenile delinquents.

Today, the weather was nice, and the sky was so blue it made people feel relaxed.

The students from the high school gathered on the sports field. According to the usual rules, they would form a circle by grade level, sitting in layers on the ground. After the instructor explained the rules, they would call out names, and those whose names were called would go to the center of the circle to spar. The instructor would then score them.

However, this time there was an unexpected change: students from all grades were mixed together, meaning higher grade students might be paired with lower grade students, under the pretext of letting older students teach the younger ones, or giving the younger ones a chance to show the older students what "new blood" could do.

An Cui immediately realized it was Cao Meng’s doing when she saw him sneering at her across the field.

Even Cao Meng’s instructor couldn't help but remind him, "Don't forget, just tap and stop. Don't overdo it. Xie Yingying's hands and mind are valuable assets to our country."

General Cao, Cao Meng’s father, was aware of his son's recent situation at school, and he probably felt frustrated as well. Shouldn't he create an opportunity for his son to turn the tide? However, he also wouldn't joke with someone who's valuable to the country. He had already warned his son to know where to stop.

"Got it, stop nagging," Cao Meng said. He wasn’t a fool. He just wanted to show this trickster who kept playing dirty tricks that he had the strength to win. Without her tricks and little gadgets, she would never have beaten him!

Cao Meng clenched his fists, eagerly waiting for the instructor to call out his and An Cui's names.

"Xie Yingying, Qin Li," the female instructor, Zhou Yu, announced.

Unexpectedly, although An Cui’s name was called, the opponent’s name wasn’t his. Cao Meng immediately looked at his instructor, who also furrowed his brows and glanced at another instructor, Zhou Yu. She was a female instructor, and she should have known how this practical exam worked—so why did she change An Cui’s opponent without asking?





==============================================================

Chapter 32: Second-Generation Heroes (7)

An Cui looked at Qin Li, who stood up from the crowd. As she passed by Zhou Yu, the instructor patted her shoulder, offering a look of encouragement. Qin Li smiled gratefully at her, but her eyes were filled with provocation and malice as she glanced at An Cui.

“Ying Jie, good luck!”

“Ying Jie, be careful. Qin Li came from the middle school division, and her fists and kicks are very strong.”

“……”

Qin Li had originally been the leader of the girls' division, and no one dared to mess with her. However, after An Cui's arrival, due to her abilities and the charm of An Dabao, most people sided with An Cui, leaving Qin Li with only a small group of followers who were just as petty and cruel as she was. During this time, Cao Meng frequently provoked An Cui, but she and her gang remained strangely silent, causing many to forget about Qin Li.

Now, as Qin Li stood up, her vicious aura sent a chill down the spines of those around her.

It was obvious she was a tough character.

An Cui walked towards Qin Li.

Qin Li was quite beautiful, but her malicious gaze made her resemble a colorful but venomous snake. Looking at An Cui's face, she sneered, "Your face is quite pretty, but too bad it’s not on my face." As soon as she finished speaking, before the instructor had even blown the whistle, she suddenly attacked An Cui.

An Cui had already anticipated that such a person wouldn’t wait for the instructor’s signal to strike. She was prepared, and thus Qin Li’s surprise attack failed. The two immediately engaged in a battle.

At 12, Qin Li had killed her stepmother, an incident that caused quite a stir at the time. Initially, people thought the stepmother had mistreated her, which led Qin Li to murder her in self-defense. However, the investigation later revealed that the stepmother had treated her very well and provided for her without neglect. The real reason Qin Li killed her was that she feared the stepmother would treat her poorly after giving birth to her own child.

Due to the laws in Country M, a 12-year-old criminal was not held criminally responsible. As a result, she was sent to Qingyan High School to continue her studies and undergo tough training and rehabilitation.

Her academic performance was poor, but her combat skills were exceptional. Anyone who saw her could feel the deadly force in her punches, which seemed as though they could shatter a table with every strike.

An Cui also felt the hardness of her punches and the agility of her movements. A right hook came at her with the force of a gale. An Cui furrowed her brows and tilted her head to avoid it, but suddenly, she felt a sharp pain on her cheek. She pulled away and touched her face, finding blood.

But before anyone could react, Qin Li attacked again.

Soon, An Cui had another cut on her face. It was strange; she had clearly avoided her punch, and their skin hadn’t even touched. Why had she been injured? Then, An Cui understood.

That despicable woman had hidden a needle in her fingers. When she threw her punch at An Cui’s face, the needle had quietly revealed its tip and sliced her cheek.

Very well. Such a person should be sent to the military, where, in times of disaster, she would be the one to push her comrades in front of danger. An Cui despised such people. Her eyes darkened with contempt.

An Cui feigned a move, tricking Qin Li into exposing the needle hidden in her fingers. When it came at her again, An Cui swiftly ducked and moved to her side. She grabbed Qin Li’s arm, bent it inward, and used her own elbow to force Qin Li’s fist back toward her. Then, with one swift kick to her knee, Qin Li fell to the ground with a loud crash.

The two moves were seamless and fast, taking only a second. Qin Li screamed in pain as she hit the ground, “Ahhh!!”

The fight was fast, and many people didn’t have time to react to why An Cui’s face suddenly started bleeding. It wasn’t until Qin Li screamed that the two instructors noticed something was wrong. They rushed forward, and the students sitting in a circle exchanged glances and began whispering among themselves.

“Qin Li! Get the nurse here now!” the male instructor shouted to the students.

“How dare you be so despicable!” Zhou Yu, the female instructor, glared at An Cui in fury. Because Qin Li had hit herself with her own punch, the consequences were severe. The needle’s tip had pierced her eye. What had initially been a small puncture became a deep wound as An Cui’s kick sent her crashing to the ground, pushing the needle fully into her eye.

An Cui frowned and took a handkerchief from her pocket to wipe the blood from her face. She coolly said, “Instructor Zhou Yu, don’t think that just because you're Zhou Zhongxiao’s daughter, you can speak nonsense with your eyes wide open. A mere Zhou Zhongxiao? Even without my adoptive father’s help, I could easily deal with him. It would be simple to find out who brought the needle. Right now, I believe you and her are accomplices. Do you think I’ll let you go? Hmm?”

An Cui’s tone was casual, and her gaze toward Zhou Yu was contemptuous and arrogant. This made Zhou Yu’s heart sink, and her anger quickly subsided. It was easy to find out who had brought the needle, and An Cui’s facial injury was proof of that. Zhou Yu’s face turned pale as she explained, “I didn’t know she would do something like that, but I believe it wasn’t intentional.”

The viewers watching the live stream, who had been laughing along with the fun brought by Cao Meng, were now in an uproar:

【What the hell, there’s actually a saint!】

【Ahhh, I can’t stand people like this! Cui Cui, kill her!!】

【So disgusting. Even though it was just one short sentence, it completely turned my stomach!】

【Every time I see these living saints, I just want to punch them!】

【[I’ll go to hell?GIF]】

【……】

An Cui coldly curled her lips and didn’t waste any more words with Zhou Yu. She turned around and walked out. On her way, she met Cao Meng, and with a sneer, she said, “Not bad, is this what you wanted me to know? Looks like when it comes to being despicable, you’re the ones who are better at it.”

Cao Meng instantly became enraged, “What did you say? I’m not in cahoots with her!”

An Cui ignored him. She got into the car that had just arrived from the medical office, even kicking the driver out and taking the car herself. The medical staff had no choice but to carry the severely injured Qin Li to the medical office on foot.

Cao Meng chased after An Cui’s car, yelling, “Hey! Stop! Tell me clearly! Who’s despicable? I have nothing to do with Qin Li, you hear me? Stop!”

This incident was reported to higher-ups.

Someone shook their head, “Zhou Zhongxiao’s daughter, I remember her well. How could she be so clueless in this situation? Why is she defending Qin Li?”

“Exactly. Qin Li hasn’t improved over the years. She’s a potential social criminal.”

“Is it because of Zhou Zhongxiao’s second wife? Sympathy for a fellow sufferer?”

Midweek, the lieutenant colonel still defended his daughter, asking, "What does it have to do with her?" If there was one mistake she made, it was being too kind, trying to give Qin Li a chance, not knowing she would act like this. Originally, it was just a small case of negligence, and with her being the lieutenant colonel's daughter, it would probably only result in submitting a self-reflection report, and nothing more.

General Yuan had been waiting for An Cui to call him, so he could help her and ease the situation between them. He also wanted to make amends. However, he never expected that An Cui never called.

An Cui didn’t call him, didn’t report to anyone, but after that day, she no longer read her professional books, stopped going to the factory they set up for her, stopped dismantling the machines, and spent all day playing cards with her classmates. Within a few days, the higher-ups became anxious.

“Doesn't Zhou Yu know that he's hindering her vision and her brain? Get her out of Qingyan immediately!”

“Compared to her casually reforming the robots' brains, what's the big deal with Lieutenant Colonel Zhou's daughter? She finally got out of the entertainment industry. If she wants to go back to writing songs and singing, who will bear the loss?!”

The brains of scientists are invaluable. Their existence often determines the future of humanity, and their worth cannot be measured by money.

So, Zhou Yu was transferred out of Qingyan High School.

Qin Li lost an eye, and without her backing, she had offended Cao Meng over this matter. Life at Qingyan became unbearable. Her sycophants scattered, all shrinking like quails, fearing they would be the next to suffer.

No one in the girls' department dared to speak against An Cui.

So, when she announced that Qingyan High School would participate in the All-English Conference and that she would select some students for training, although everyone thought An Cui was dreaming and found it absurd, no one dared to show their dissatisfaction. The selected students obediently stood up, hiding their displeasure.

“Ying Jie, our school is going to participate... it’s just to humiliate ourselves,” someone raised their hand and said softly.

“Why?”

“Our school is quite special. It's called a military school, but it's not as professional as other military schools. It's also not a normal school; it’s more like a reform school for troubled kids. Compared to other real military schools, we’re very looked down upon,” she said, seemingly indifferent, but a hint of gloom flashed in her eyes. Others shared her sentiment.

The uniqueness of Qingyan High School meant that every student harbored some trauma, feeling abandoned by their parents, sent to this place as rebellious children.

The All-English Conference is a national event that has replaced the Olympics in terms of attention, with multiple TV and online channels broadcasting from opening to closing. While all military schools can sign up, only the most outstanding ones dare to participate.

If military schools are ranked by size, teaching resources, and facilities, Qingyan High School would be at the bottom. If they participated, they would be despised by the students from elite military schools.

“What are you afraid of?” An Cui glanced at them and said, “As long as I’m here, we will be first. All you need to do is stand tall, walk forward, and show the world that we have arrived.”

524: "...Such a typical, cringe-worthy line! I’m so embarrassed I want to curl my toes!!"

Though it seemed like a dramatic line to adults, to teenagers going through their rebellious phase, it was exhilarating and full of passion... but reality soon brought them down to earth.

Even the instructors and teachers were stunned when they heard An Cui wanted to enter the All-English Conference. They couldn't believe it. But An Cui wasn't asking for their approval; she was merely informing them.

“Wow, the brain of a genius really works differently from ours,” the instructor muttered, watching An Cui’s back.

“What is she trying to do? She could stay in the lab and work on robots. Why bother with the All-English Conference? What if she gets laughed at?”

“Even if she gets laughed at, it won’t matter. The All-English Conference isn’t a joke. Those who dare to show up are all the best.”

“By the way, Xie Yingying’s second brother, Yuan Yao, the son of General Yuan, is a student at the Zhengshi Military School. He will also participate in the All-English Conference. Maybe with him there, it’ll go better…”

“……”

No matter what others said, An Cui had already made up her mind to participate.

No one expected that when An Cui said, “Stand tall, walk forward,” she meant it literally.

She stopped the girls’ department from attending classes and took them to the field for training. She selected sixty girls from the three grades in the high school department, arranged them in three rows of twenty.

The selected girls had no idea what An Cui wanted them to do, only knowing they had to follow her instructions. It turned out, An Cui just wanted them to walk. However, every detail was strictly controlled—from the spacing between them to the height of their steps, the size of their strides, the force with which they placed their feet, and even the arc of their arm movements. Every centimeter mattered. It seemed easy, but training turned out to be grueling and difficult. They would have preferred to be back in the classroom.

Those who protested were swiftly shut down, with An Cui, the "Demon King," declaring, “We won’t go back to class until this formation is perfect and powerful!”

They could only continue training with tears in their eyes.

The instructors were equally baffled, growing more convinced that An Cui was just playing around. If she really wanted to enter the All-English Conference, she should be focusing on physical training, requesting shooting lessons... Instead, she had them practicing marching under the hot sun?

The boys’ department heard about An Cui’s plans and Cao Meng immediately brought a group to mock her, only to see the girls' training and laugh uproariously.

“Hey, is this a group of elementary school students walking in line after school?”

“Hahahaha…”

An Cui was looking at the three rows of girls, thinking the number was too few to be impressive. Hearing the laughter, she slowly turned her gaze to the group of tall, hormone-fueled boys in the boys' department.

The boys who had been laughing suddenly felt a chill run down their spines.

=========================================================


Chapter 33: The Next Generation of Heroes (VIII)

An Cui: "Hey, Cao Meng."

Cao Meng immediately became vigilant: "What is it?"

"Come with me for a moment," An Cui said as she turned and walked away. An Dabao, who had been squatting nearby, immediately followed with quick steps.

"You tell me to come with you, and I just follow? Isn't that too embarrassing?" Cao Meng yelled at An Cui's back. However, seeing that An Cui didn't stop walking, he cursed under his breath and chased after her.

An Cui led him to her exclusive factory.

Cao Meng: "What is it?"

"I’m preparing to participate in the All-English Competition. You should come too."

"Huh? You’re going crazy and want to drag me along? Do you think I’m a fool?!"

An Cui: "Yes."

"Crap…"

"Stop talking nonsense. You’re from the Cao family, and you started out at a prestigious military academy. But because of a fight, you were sent to this kind of prison school. I don’t need to say much about the reasons. Let me ask you: are you really content to be under your proud older brother's thumb forever? Are you okay with being looked down on by your father? You’re in your third year of high school, and you’ll graduate next year. Do you want to enter the military like a nobody, serve in the lower ranks for three years, and then start all over again in society?"

This wasn't a secret. General Cao had two sons. He constantly talked about his eldest son and would praise him in front of everyone. But he rarely mentioned his younger son. Both children were his own, but his preference for his eldest son was well-known.

The reason General Cao favored his eldest son wasn't without cause. He had a fiery temper and a strong competitive spirit, holding high expectations for both his subordinates and himself. His eldest son, whether in terms of intelligence or ability, was exceptionally outstanding, a top performer among his peers. With such a perfect older brother, General Cao had very high expectations for Cao Meng, comparing him to his older brother, Cao Jiao, since childhood. Whenever Cao Meng made a mistake, General Cao would harshly criticize and nitpick him.

Cao Meng’s expression turned cold. "You think saying all this will make me go along with you and embarrass myself?"

"Do you really think other military school students will defeat you badly?"

"Our school doesn’t have important subjects like shooting, military courses, or practical drills. We don’t have the military academies, military scientific institutes, or military hospitals that regular military schools have. We only do running, squats, and horse stance. You think this is a military school? You want to participate in the All-English Competition? Let me ask you, how will you compare with others?" Cao Meng asked with a serious face, thinking that An Cui was really crazy to think they could participate in the competition without embarrassing themselves in front of the entire nation.

"That’s right. Qingyan High School is indeed lacking compared to real military schools. It would be unfair to let Qingyan students compete against students from real military schools. But one of the most interesting aspects of the All-English Competition is that, in order to show the public the excellence and reliability of young people and the diverse development of military schools, the students participating in the competition will use weapons and equipment developed by their own school's military scientific research institute."

"So what? Our school doesn’t have a military science—" Cao Meng suddenly thought of something and looked at An Cui with wide eyes, shocked.

An Cui smiled strangely at him: "What if, at the All-English Competition, each of us has a mech like An Dabao’s? Wouldn’t that scene be spectacular?"

Cao Meng didn’t know what a mech was, but he knew An Dabao. He had always dreamed of how to get his hands on An Dabao. Hearing An Cui say this, he imagined the scene and his facial muscles twitched. He didn’t know what expression to make, but it seemed like he was incredibly excited. Finally, he blurted out, "Damn!"

The audience in the live stream couldn’t help but laugh like pigs:

【Oh my god, hahahahaha, they’re really going to make mechs!!】
【I’m kneeling so hard, my knees are about to break, just let me keep kneeling for Cui Cui! My knees are all yours!】
【Hahahaha, watching the big boss crush noobs feels so satisfying, my scalp is tingling】
【I can’t wait to see that scene, I’m so excited!】
【My Cui Cui’s live stream always brings such extreme comfort, love it】
【...】

No one knew exactly what An Cui said to Cao Meng, but after their conversation, 60 students from the boys' department, like their counterparts in the girls' department, were plunged into an intense training regime.

A total of 120 students, plus Cao Meng himself, 121 in total, were now training from morning to night under Cao Meng's strict supervision. They were taught how to march in formation, how to march with power and presence. An Cui also designed two sets of military uniforms and shoes for them, one for men and one for women. She called Yuan Rong, asking him to find a factory to make them and to send the experts who had helped her before. She also requested a pile of materials. When Yuan Rong asked her what it was for, An Cui didn’t hide it and told him she was preparing a mech combat team for the All-English Competition.

Although Yuan Rong didn’t know what a mech was, his instincts told him it must be something very powerful. After thinking it over, he decided that since the All-English Competition would be broadcasted nationwide and other countries would see it, why not turn it into a grand global launch event? It would definitely catch a lot of attention.

...

While An Cui was busy working day and night, Yuan Qingning was also busy. She was shooting her first movie, playing the lead role for the first time, and it was directed by a master, making it a hot topic even before it started filming.

"Qingning, my dear, look what good news I’ve brought you!" Sun Li arrived on set, beaming with joy.

"What is it?"

"The All-English Competition opening ceremony!" Sun Li leaned close to Yuan Qingning's ear and whispered, "I told the director of the opening ceremony that you are General Yuan’s daughter, and he agreed to let you join the singing group."

Although the All-English Conference is not an international event, given the current global situation, people are eager to feel the sense of security brought by the country's strength. Therefore, each session of the All-English Conference is a national, even global, event that attracts widespread attention. The opening ceremony is naturally a grand affair, and only heavyweight stars can appear there. For someone like Yuan Qingning, a rising star, she originally didn't qualify to be part of it, but since she is General Yuan's adopted daughter, she certainly has the privilege of taking a shortcut.

"I got it, thank you, Brother Sun," Yuan Qingning smiled, though there was little surprise in her heart. In her past life, Xie Yingying also sang at the All-English Conference's opening ceremony, instantly rising to fame and even gaining recognition abroad. Now that she’s been reborn, she will reclaim everything that belongs to her, including shining at the opening ceremony and becoming a household name.

Since her rebirth, her life had been smooth sailing, and everything seemed perfect. The only things that still bothered her were that despite all her efforts, Yuan Rong still hadn't shown any signs of falling in love with her, and she really wanted to visit Qingyan Middle School to see An Cui's miserable situation, but had never been able to get in.

However, she had no time to care about these things now. After all, why should a cloud in the sky care about the mud on the ground?

...

In the past three months, they spent over a month training from morning till night. The 121 students finally perfected their formations, every detail now a reflex. The steps, knee heights, and arm swings were all precise, as if measured with a ruler.

However, not all 121 people were meant to participate in the competition. The number was too large, and there wasn’t enough time to prepare that many pieces of equipment. So, An Cui selected 20 male and female students who were the strongest, had the best reflexes, and learned the fastest.

Every day, these 20 students, along with Cao Meng, were taken to the mountain by An Cui. Others didn't know what they were doing, but they were secretly relieved—after all, they had already nearly died from practicing the formations, and adding anything else would have been unbearable.

For some reason, the 20 selected ones went out looking like they had lost their loved ones, but returned with faces full of suppressed excitement. When asked what they had been doing, they all tightly shut their mouths and refused to reveal anything.

It wasn't until the eve of the All-English Conference that An Cui allowed everyone to see the results of her efforts. The ones who hadn’t been chosen immediately went from relief to regret. They had also wanted to participate and stand out, and now, seeing those who had been selected, they felt envy, jealousy, and frustration.

In short, after seeing the equipment, even the students who had initially doubted their ability to participate in the All-English Conference started to gain confidence and even looked forward to it.

...

Qingyan Middle School's application for participation in the All-English Conference had been approved, and all participating schools had received their lists. Normally, any military school in the country could apply, but only those with strength dared to, because a crushing defeat would bring shame to both the school and the students. The schools that dared to apply were usually those with a strong reputation, like Zhengshi Military Academy and Huangshi Military Academy. Therefore, the list rarely changed, which made Qingyan Middle School’s inclusion especially noticeable.

"Qingyan Middle School?? Which one?"
"Qingyan Middle School? Isn’t that the prison school?"
"No way? Is this a joke? Did the committee get it wrong? Qingyan Middle School, participating in the All-English Conference? Why would they want to embarrass themselves in front of the whole nation?"
"Can I report them to get them kicked out?"
"Yuan Yao, you have a sister at Qingyan Middle School, right?"

Yuan Yao, who had his feet up on the table, one hand supporting his head and the other holding a list, replied casually when he heard the conversation.
"She wouldn’t be one of the students attending the All-English Conference, would she?"
"Are you kidding?" Yuan Yao scoffed. "Xie Yingying attending the All-English Conference? Ridiculous. In my memory, she’s always been a cowardly, unlikable girl. She clearly wanted to fit in with our family, but never made an effort. Every time we reached out, she took half a step forward and then immediately stepped back. Eventually, I lost patience with her. This sister of mine is like a non-existent person. Who cares about her? Someone like her attending the All-English Conference? That’s just a joke."
