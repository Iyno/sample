Chapter 31: The Cook 30
Yan Langqing had been feeling unsettled lately, and the source of it all was Lin Dan—a person she had long forgotten, yet who had suddenly reappeared. She had once tasted Lin Dan’s four signature dishes, having them packed and delivered to the palace. Their flavors were indeed exquisite.

She had tried to replicate them, using the same ingredients and seasonings, but no matter what she did, she simply couldn't achieve Lin Dan’s taste. Lin Dan must have had unique techniques—ones that others could neither discern nor imitate. Without her personal guidance, even having the recipe would be useless.

Such an extraordinary level of skill was something only veteran chefs with decades, or even a lifetime, of experience could master. But how old was Lin Dan? She was two years younger than Yan Langqing, only twenty-two this year, yet she had already far surpassed everyone else. Yan Langqing had to admit that she felt uneasy, but as the imperial chef, her pride would not allow her to concede defeat to an ordinary cook.

She was determined to attend the competition, but she would have to wait until the palace’s rest day. However, before that day arrived, trouble came knocking. A few guards stormed into the imperial kitchen, their blades gleaming, and demanded, “Who made the Eight Treasures Tofu today? Step forward immediately!”

“It was me,” Yan Langqing responded calmly, stepping up. With the emperor’s favor, she feared nothing in the palace.

“Besides you, who else handled that dish?” the guards questioned further.

Several palace maids and eunuchs stepped forward—Yan Langqing’s trusted aides. Among them was a young man who often went out to seek gourmet delicacies on her behalf.

“Tie them up and send them to the Office of Strict Punishment!” The guards wasted no time, binding them and dragging them away.

Hearing that they were being sent to that hellish prison, Yan Langqing finally panicked. Struggling, she urgently asked, “Sirs, what crime have we committed?”

“You don’t know what you’ve done?” The guards gagged them and dragged them off.

This incident was neither minor nor major, but it involved a serious diplomatic blunder. The emperor had been hosting Mongolian princes in the palace, negotiating the purchase of warhorses. One of the princes had informed the imperial kitchen staff that he was allergic to peanuts, which would make him ill. The staff member had agreed, yet still served a dish of Eight Treasures Tofu containing peanut sauce. As soon as the prince ate it, he broke out in red rashes and suffered unbearable itching. The banquet was ruined, and the horse trade was postponed until he recovered.

To appease the prince, the emperor ordered a thorough investigation, which led straight to Yan Langqing. She genuinely had no knowledge of the prince’s allergy—no one had informed her—but as the head chef and the one who prepared the dish, the emperor had no choice but to have her detained for questioning.

Once it was confirmed that there was no espionage or conspiracy involved—only an unfortunate mistake—the Office of Strict Punishment prepared to release them. However, just then, Prince Gong arrived. Without a word, he threw down two bamboo canes and ordered fifty lashes each for Yan Langqing and her apprentice—the young eunuch.

As the emperor’s favored chef, Yan Langqing was spared from severe punishment; the executioners lifted their hands high and brought them down gently. But her apprentice wasn’t so lucky—by the time the questioning ended, he was covered in blood, barely recognizable. When they dragged him out of the prison, he was on the brink of death.

Yan Langqing herself could barely stand, her legs weak, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face. People often said that the palace was a place that devoured people alive. Because of the emperor’s favor, she had never felt that way before. But today, she finally understood—this dark prison was a gaping maw, waiting to swallow people whole.

While being interrogated on the blood-stained floor, she vaguely heard Prince Gong say, “My royal brother ordered that they be beaten severely… for offending his precious treasure… Ha! Not a concubine, but a mere cook—an extraordinary one at that…”

Yan Langqing was no fool. She quickly realized that her punishment wasn’t just about the mistake with the dish—she had offended someone she shouldn’t have. But who was it? The first suspects that came to mind were the other imperial chefs. After all, only if she was removed would the position of head chef become available.

Now, she viewed everyone as a potential enemy. She could no longer stand staying in the imperial kitchen and just wanted to return home. But before she could leave, an imperial decree arrived—she was stripped of her title as an imperial chef and expelled from the palace. She stood there in shock, filled with resentment and humiliation.

She had truly known nothing about the prince’s allergy. No one had warned her. She had been framed. But without evidence, she couldn’t defend herself. Before she could even change out of her bloodstained clothes, she was thrown onto a carriage and sent away.

As for her young eunuch apprentice, who had often helped her search for gourmet foods outside the palace—his injuries were severe. He was discarded in the Ye Ting Bureau, his survival uncertain. Even if he lived, he would never return to the imperial kitchen. Instead, he would be sent to serve the madwomen in the Cold Palace or clean latrines in the Laundry Bureau. A lifetime of suffering awaited him.

Her son had been beaten bloody by the authorities, terrifying Madam Zhou. She anxiously asked what they should do next. Their shop had been smashed, their sign destroyed, and a powerful figure had declared they were forbidden from reopening. Were they really supposed to kneel and beg that little wretch Lin Dan for help? No matter how she thought about it, Madam Zhou found the idea unbearable. But if they didn’t, their family was doomed. They had already lost a hundred thousand taels of silver—a devastating blow that would take at least a decade to recover from.

Gritting his teeth, Yan Shouye said, “Beg? Why would we beg? Lin Dan has her backers, and so do we. Ours is the emperor himself. Once Langqing returns, she’ll plead with the emperor, and everything will be fine. Our Langqing is destined to become an imperial concubine.”

“I thought you said she was going to be a marquis’ wife?” Madam Zhou finally felt a bit relieved.
