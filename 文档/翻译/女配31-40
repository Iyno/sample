Chapter 31: The Cook 30
Yan Langqing had been feeling unsettled lately, and the source of it all was Lin Dan—a person she had long forgotten, yet who had suddenly reappeared. She had once tasted Lin Dan’s four signature dishes, having them packed and delivered to the palace. Their flavors were indeed exquisite.

She had tried to replicate them, using the same ingredients and seasonings, but no matter what she did, she simply couldn't achieve Lin Dan’s taste. Lin Dan must have had unique techniques—ones that others could neither discern nor imitate. Without her personal guidance, even having the recipe would be useless.

Such an extraordinary level of skill was something only veteran chefs with decades, or even a lifetime, of experience could master. But how old was Lin Dan? She was two years younger than Yan Langqing, only twenty-two this year, yet she had already far surpassed everyone else. Yan Langqing had to admit that she felt uneasy, but as the imperial chef, her pride would not allow her to concede defeat to an ordinary cook.

She was determined to attend the competition, but she would have to wait until the palace’s rest day. However, before that day arrived, trouble came knocking. A few guards stormed into the imperial kitchen, their blades gleaming, and demanded, “Who made the Eight Treasures Tofu today? Step forward immediately!”

“It was me,” Yan Langqing responded calmly, stepping up. With the emperor’s favor, she feared nothing in the palace.

“Besides you, who else handled that dish?” the guards questioned further.

Several palace maids and eunuchs stepped forward—Yan Langqing’s trusted aides. Among them was a young man who often went out to seek gourmet delicacies on her behalf.

“Tie them up and send them to the Office of Strict Punishment!” The guards wasted no time, binding them and dragging them away.

Hearing that they were being sent to that hellish prison, Yan Langqing finally panicked. Struggling, she urgently asked, “Sirs, what crime have we committed?”

“You don’t know what you’ve done?” The guards gagged them and dragged them off.

This incident was neither minor nor major, but it involved a serious diplomatic blunder. The emperor had been hosting Mongolian princes in the palace, negotiating the purchase of warhorses. One of the princes had informed the imperial kitchen staff that he was allergic to peanuts, which would make him ill. The staff member had agreed, yet still served a dish of Eight Treasures Tofu containing peanut sauce. As soon as the prince ate it, he broke out in red rashes and suffered unbearable itching. The banquet was ruined, and the horse trade was postponed until he recovered.

To appease the prince, the emperor ordered a thorough investigation, which led straight to Yan Langqing. She genuinely had no knowledge of the prince’s allergy—no one had informed her—but as the head chef and the one who prepared the dish, the emperor had no choice but to have her detained for questioning.

Once it was confirmed that there was no espionage or conspiracy involved—only an unfortunate mistake—the Office of Strict Punishment prepared to release them. However, just then, Prince Gong arrived. Without a word, he threw down two bamboo canes and ordered fifty lashes each for Yan Langqing and her apprentice—the young eunuch.

As the emperor’s favored chef, Yan Langqing was spared from severe punishment; the executioners lifted their hands high and brought them down gently. But her apprentice wasn’t so lucky—by the time the questioning ended, he was covered in blood, barely recognizable. When they dragged him out of the prison, he was on the brink of death.

Yan Langqing herself could barely stand, her legs weak, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face. People often said that the palace was a place that devoured people alive. Because of the emperor’s favor, she had never felt that way before. But today, she finally understood—this dark prison was a gaping maw, waiting to swallow people whole.

While being interrogated on the blood-stained floor, she vaguely heard Prince Gong say, “My royal brother ordered that they be beaten severely… for offending his precious treasure… Ha! Not a concubine, but a mere cook—an extraordinary one at that…”

Yan Langqing was no fool. She quickly realized that her punishment wasn’t just about the mistake with the dish—she had offended someone she shouldn’t have. But who was it? The first suspects that came to mind were the other imperial chefs. After all, only if she was removed would the position of head chef become available.

Now, she viewed everyone as a potential enemy. She could no longer stand staying in the imperial kitchen and just wanted to return home. But before she could leave, an imperial decree arrived—she was stripped of her title as an imperial chef and expelled from the palace. She stood there in shock, filled with resentment and humiliation.

She had truly known nothing about the prince’s allergy. No one had warned her. She had been framed. But without evidence, she couldn’t defend herself. Before she could even change out of her bloodstained clothes, she was thrown onto a carriage and sent away.

As for her young eunuch apprentice, who had often helped her search for gourmet foods outside the palace—his injuries were severe. He was discarded in the Ye Ting Bureau, his survival uncertain. Even if he lived, he would never return to the imperial kitchen. Instead, he would be sent to serve the madwomen in the Cold Palace or clean latrines in the Laundry Bureau. A lifetime of suffering awaited him.

—

Her son had been beaten bloody by the authorities, terrifying Madam Zhou. She anxiously asked what they should do next. Their shop had been smashed, their sign destroyed, and a powerful figure had declared they were forbidden from reopening. Were they really supposed to kneel and beg that little wretch Lin Dan for help? No matter how she thought about it, Madam Zhou found the idea unbearable. But if they didn’t, their family was doomed. They had already lost a hundred thousand taels of silver—a devastating blow that would take at least a decade to recover from.

Gritting his teeth, Yan Shouye said, “Beg? Why would we beg? Lin Dan has her backers, and so do we. Ours is the emperor himself. Once Langqing returns, she’ll plead with the emperor, and everything will be fine. Our Langqing is destined to become an imperial concubine.”

“I thought you said she was going to be a marquis’ wife?” Madam Zhou finally felt a bit relieved.

Madam Hou is nothing; being a consort is far better. All these years, I’ve held Langqing back from getting married, and you blamed me for delaying her future. But look now—if I hadn’t restrained her, would she have such fortune today? Once Langqing returns, our family’s troubles will be over. I’ll have her file a complaint before His Majesty and punish Weiyuan Hou’s people to avenge me!” The more Yan Shouye spoke, the more agitated he became. He propped himself up and shouted, “Someone, go check if the young lady has returned!”

Immediately, a maid ran outside. Shortly after, she rushed back, hoarse from shouting, “Something terrible has happened! The young lady… the young lady came back covered in blood! She’s also been stripped of her position as an imperial chef!”

The palace attendants who escorted Yan Langqing home had been instructed by Prince Gong to publicly announce her demotion and expulsion from the palace. They made no effort to spare the Yan family’s dignity, declaring the news right at the entrance. Passersby, who were mostly neighbors long oppressed by Madam Zhou and Yan Shouye, couldn’t hide their schadenfreude. Serves them right! They thought their daughter becoming an imperial chef made them superior, looking down on everyone else. And now? They finally got what they deserved!

Yan Langqing was so humiliated that she covered her head with a thin blanket before letting the servants carry her out of the carriage. As she entered the house and saw her father lying sick in bed, she was utterly shocked.

Yan Shouye panicked completely. Only now did he reveal the truth about oppressing Lin Dan’s mother and setting fire to the hometown restaurant. Gritting his teeth, he said, “How was I supposed to know that within just two or three months of returning to the capital, she’d befriend so many powerful figures, all willing to stand up for her? If I had known—”

If I had known, I wouldn’t have provoked her!

But Yan Shouye couldn’t bring himself to say the last part. After a moment of contemplation, he muttered, “We can’t rely on His Majesty anymore. Langqing, send a letter to Tang Peng and ask for his help. You probably don’t know, but last time Tang Peng hosted several Mongolian princes at the hometown restaurant and was thoroughly humiliated by Lin Dan. He already detests her. When I mentioned burning down the restaurant and asked for his help in dealing with the southern district officials, he agreed without hesitation. Moreover, he did it for your sake. If you ask him personally, he won’t refuse.

"Our family cannot survive without reopening a shop. What will we eat and drink otherwise? But to reopen, we need a patron. Tang Peng is at least the Vice Minister of War and the son of Yongding Hou. With his influence, even Prince Cheng wouldn’t dare smash our signboard again.”

Yan Shouye rambled on, but Yan Langqing only caught four words—"Mongolian princes.” A chill ran down her spine, and she immediately asked, “The Mongolian princes dined at Lin Dan’s place? She has connections with them?”

“How could she have connections with them? It was Young Master Tang who brought them there. A few years ago, he fought alongside the Mongols against the Xiongnu. They have strong ties,” Yan Shouye explained, eager to buy himself an official position and well-informed on court affairs.

“The young master… It was the young master…” Yan Langqing froze, tears welling up in her eyes. She had thought she was framed by the imperial kitchen, but it turned out Tang Shizi had a hand in it as well. Of course—who else could have invited Mongolian royalty or reached deep into the palace?

And then there were Prince Cheng and Prince Gong—both supporting Lin Dan. She had worked tirelessly in the palace, making so many contributions for her family, yet everything crumbled overnight. Why?

Overcome with sorrow, Yan Langqing roared, “Father, didn’t I tell you to live quietly and stay out of trouble? Did my words mean nothing to you? Years ago, because of your mess, I was expelled from Hou’s manor and have been resented by the young master ever since. Now, you stirred up trouble again, and I’ve been cast out of the palace in disgrace. Are you satisfied now? How many more times will you drag me down?”

Watching his daughter collapse onto a chair in tears, Yan Shouye was both ashamed and regretful but utterly helpless. He stammered, “I didn’t expect Lin Dan to be such a thorny hedgehog—impossible to touch. How about… how about you still send that letter to Tang Peng? He’ll surely help you.”



===================================================================

Chapter 32: The Cook 31

Lin Dan stayed in the outskirts of the capital for only two nights before returning. She had already sold her shop to Qin Erniang and needed to move her belongings out to make space for the new owner.

“Can’t you keep this shop? Why not continue running the Home-style Restaurant?” Qin Erniang felt like the biggest fool in the world—she had bought Lin Dan’s shop, yet she still wished to return it. The thought of never again tasting Lin Dan’s cooking made life seem unbearable.

“I won’t run it anymore. My business in the capital is almost settled, and it’s time for me to move on.” Lin Dan had long grown accustomed to a wandering life and never stayed in one place for too long.

As they spoke, persistent knocking sounded from outside, accompanied by voices calling, “Has Shopkeeper Lin returned? When will the restaurant reopen? Shopkeeper Lin, Shopkeeper Lin…” After shouting for a long while without receiving a response, the people outside finally sighed in disappointment and left.

This had happened several times in the past few days while Lin Dan was away. Almost every so often, customers would come knocking, asking if the restaurant was open. Now that the Home-style Restaurant had closed, the people of the southern district could only dream of having authentic hometown dishes again.

In these times, those who could leave their hometowns to earn a living in the capital were mostly strong young men. They hardly knew how to cook, and even if they did, their food could never compare to Lin Dan’s. Thus, they were left with no choice but to gnaw on coarse cornbread.

Who would want to suffer if they could live comfortably? Who would choose coarse cornbread when they could have delicious and affordable food? Life was hard without Shopkeeper Lin!

Lin Dan paid no attention to the commotion outside and focused on packing her belongings. Qin Erniang, on the other hand, scoffed, “We’re not opening the door! Let them stew in their own frustration! They enjoyed the restaurant’s food so much, but when trouble came knocking, not a single one of them stood up to help. A bunch of ungrateful beasts!”

Lin Dan smiled without responding. They weren’t exactly beasts—this was simply how the world worked. But she was still grateful to Qin Erniang. If it weren’t for her leading the girls from the brothel to drive away Madam Zhou that day, the woman might have caused trouble for much longer. People helping you was kindness; not helping you was simply their choice—no one could be blamed.

That was why Lin Dan had sold the shop to Qin Erniang at the low price of ten taels of silver, even throwing in a recipe for wine and a few dishes to go with it. A brothel wasn’t a place for meals, but drinks and snacks were always needed. This was enough to repay the favor.

As the two continued tidying up, sudden shrieks of agony rang out from outside, followed by sounds of begging and kneeling. The noise was chaotic and unsettling.

“Who’s fighting outside? I’ll go take a look. You stay inside and hide,” Qin Erniang said, tossing aside her broom and heading toward the door.

Lin Dan wouldn’t let her take the risk. She pulled Qin Erniang behind her, grabbed a kitchen knife, and stepped outside. Peeking through a crack in the door, she saw Tang Jiu standing upright on the steps, while several guards pinned down a group of ruffians, using the backs of their knives to break their hands one by one.

The wailing and pleas for mercy came from these ruffians. Kneeling beside them, bound tightly with ropes, was a young man—Tang Peng. His back was strapped with thorny branches, and he shouted angrily, “Ninth Brother, you’re humiliating me like this for an outsider? When I return, I’ll write to Uncle about this!”

“You abused your power and bullied the people, yet you think you have the right to complain?” Tang Jiu’s tone was indifferent.

“And isn’t what you’re doing now also an abuse of power?” Tang Peng struggled, only to be forcibly pressed to the ground by Zhao Liu.

Tang Jiu ignored him. Hearing movement behind him, he turned around, and his eyes lit up. “Lin Dan, you’re back.”

“What’s going on here?” Lin Dan instinctively raised her hand to point at Tang Peng and the ruffians, only to realize she was still holding the kitchen knife. She quickly lowered it.

Tang Jiu cupped his hands apologetically and said, “The authorities ignored the arson case because of Tang Peng’s influence. So today, I’ve brought him here to accept punishment. These ruffians are the ones who set the fire.” Clearly, he had already heard about Lin Dan’s return and had come specifically to settle the matter.

Understanding dawned on Lin Dan. She glanced at Tang Peng, who was still shouting and cursing, then said with gratitude, “Thank you for standing up for me, Your Highness. I accept your apology.” With that, she turned to close the door.

Tang Jiu quickly blocked the door with his hand, his voice tinged with plea. “Then… will you stay this time?”

Ten years ago, he couldn’t make Lin Dan stay. Ten years later, he hoped to change that ending. No one knew how many times he had dreamed of her stubborn back as she walked away, disappearing into the mist, leaving him to wake up with regret and guilt.

If only he hadn’t blindly believed others, forcing Lin Dan to compete against Yan Langqing, her father wouldn’t have died dishonored. He had practically grown up eating the meals cooked by Lin Dan’s father and should have known better. Yet back then, it was as if he had been bewitched—he believed everything Yan Langqing said, ultimately leading to the downfall of the Lin family, forcing Lin Dan and her mother to wander homeless for years.

He had lived his life without regrets—except for how he had wronged the late Lin family, Lin Dan, and her mother. Seeing Lin Dan return to the capital and reestablish her family’s legacy filled him with joy. He knew just how talented she was. Given enough time, she could surpass even her father’s achievements.

Yet, some people refused to let her succeed, throwing obstacle after obstacle in her way, forcing her to leave once more. By now, Tang Jiu’s hatred for the Yan family had seeped into his bones—otherwise, he wouldn’t have pulled strings to strip Yan Langqing of her title as imperial chef.

This time, he repeated with greater urgency, “Will you stay? I promise no one will dare oppress you again.”

Lin Danqian gave a faint smile but still firmly shook her head.

Tang Jiu’s anticipation instantly faded. Just as he was about to say something else, a man squeezed through the crowd with a cautious demeanor and said, “I am a servant of the Yan family. I have come to deliver a letter for my young lady.”

“Give it to me,” Lin Dan extended her hand to receive the letter and let out a slow breath. The person she had been waiting for had finally arrived…

Tang Jiu glanced at the letter and saw a line of words written in delicate calligraphy: June 6th, Xiang Garden Gathering.

Xiang Garden was an imperial estate. Ordinary people couldn’t even approach it, let alone enter. It was one of the emperor’s favorite gardens, constantly guarded by imperial sentries. Given Yan Langqing’s status, how could she possibly have access to it? Could it be that she had the emperor’s approval?

Thinking of this, Tang Jiu suddenly recalled the message his sister had sent him, mentioning that in recent years, the emperor had shown great favor toward Yan Langqing and seemed to have intentions of bringing her into the harem. This was also the reason why rumors had spread about the noble consort planning to arrange a marriage for Yan Langqing, intending to have her wed into the marquis’s household.

If the emperor was indeed backing Yan Langqing, this competition might not be fair at all. He lowered his voice and said, “Xiang Garden is an imperial estate; without an edict, no one can use it. The last person who hosted a gathering there was the Grand Princess.”

Lin Dan slightly furrowed her brows, then nodded and said, “I understand. Thank you for the reminder, Your Highness.” Her tone was calm and composed, as if entirely unbothered.

Tang Jiu couldn’t tell what she was thinking and continued, “I can find a way to cancel this competition.” If the competition wasn’t going to be fair, there was no need to participate. First, they could let Yan Langqing fall out of favor with the emperor, and then they could compete at a later time. Fairness was rare in this world, but he wanted to give Lin Dan justice—justice that had been long overdue for ten years.

“There’s no need. I have my own way of dealing with it.” Lin Dan shook her head with a smile. She had waited for ten years and no longer had the patience to wait any longer.

“Think it over again. With the emperor’s favor, the judges won’t dare let Yan Langqing lose,” Tang Jiu tried one last time to dissuade her.

Lin Dan waved her hand, her answer unchanged: “I have my own way. Your Highness need not worry.”

Tang Jiu gritted his teeth as he looked at her, feeling both helpless and moved. Lin Dan was still as stubborn as ever, but it was precisely this stubbornness that had shaped her into the person she was today.

“Fine, I’ll find a way for you!” With that, he dragged Tang Peng away in large strides.

Qin Erniang tiptoed to peek at the letter and sighed. “Xiang Garden, huh? That’s the emperor’s favorite place. Ordinary people aren’t allowed in. Manager Lin, don’t be so stubborn with His Highness Tang. Sometimes, compromising a little doesn’t mean you’ve lost. We all know your skills—there’s no need to crash an egg against a rock.”

Lin Dan shook her head, her gaze unwavering.

—

June 6th arrived quickly. Lin Dan accepted the invitation and, after passing through multiple checkpoints and thorough inspections, was finally allowed to enter Xiang Garden. Inside, guards were stationed every five steps, with pavilions appearing every ten steps. Everywhere, patrolling sentries and stern-faced palace attendants moved about, exuding an air of imperial majesty.

For an ordinary person, just entering this place would be enough to make them tremble with fear, let alone compete in a contest. Clearly, before they had even met, Yan Langqing had already tried to intimidate Lin Dan.

Lin Dan didn’t know who she truly was, but she could guess that her situation must be quite extraordinary, perhaps even turbulent. Otherwise, she wouldn’t feel the slightest bit of fear in such an imposing setting—her heart remained as still as a pool of dead water, without even a ripple.

She walked into the inner courtyard with a calm demeanor, entered the main hall, and immediately knelt to bow upon seeing a handsome man seated in the host’s position. The man wore bright yellow-soled boots—it was undoubtedly the emperor.

“Rise,” the emperor said, smiling magnanimously. “I heard you are competing with Langqing in a culinary contest, so I left the palace to personally witness it.”

He continued with a gracious tone, “In this competition, you both may showcase your skills without concern. Just state whatever ingredients you need, and the palace attendants will prepare them for you.”

Yan Langqing lowered her head, covering her mouth as if shy. The emperor glanced at her and smiled even more warmly. His words seemed impartial, yet within them, he subtly revealed his close relationship with Yan Langqing. Who would dare defy his intentions now?

The judges exchanged glances, each deep in thought. They included retired imperial chefs, renowned gourmet connoisseurs, and the head chefs of famous restaurants—all experts in the culinary arts.

Lin Dan swept her gaze over them and immediately understood—most of them had likely been involved in that past competition, as if history was repeating itself. She also noticed several familiar faces among the spectators: Prince Tang, Prince Cheng, Prince Gong, Marquis Weiyuan, and the Prince of Dianqian. Even Yan Shouye, who had been beaten and should have been bedridden, had come. He was staring at her with a mixture of resentment and smugness.

Lin Dan curtsied and directly asked, “Your Majesty, can you guarantee the fairness of this competition?”

The emperor prided himself on being a wise ruler. In the early years of his reign, he had promoted open discourse and recruited talented individuals. He was also known for tolerating outspoken officials who dared to criticize him. Now that Lin Dan had laid things bare, he had no choice but to nod, whether he wished to or not.
