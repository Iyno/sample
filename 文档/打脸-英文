Chapter 1.1
A man was knocked to the ground, a chilling sword pressed against his throat. His bloodstained eyes were filled with bottomless hatred.

Opposite him stood a man clad in a black Taoist robe. His handsome face exuded charm, yet the slight upward curve of his lips carried an overwhelming sense of wickedness. He screamed inwardly, "Kill him! Kill him!" but his hand holding the sword remained still. Instead, he began to ramble, recounting the past—how he annihilated the man's family, slaughtered his parents and siblings, and tormented him over the years.

"Enough nonsense! If you keep talking, you'll be the one dying next!" The handsome man's inner voice roared.

When he finally regained control and raised his sword to strike, the woman who should have been lying nearby, barely clinging to life, suddenly sprang up. A dagger, sharp enough to slice through iron like butter, plunged into his back.

He turned his head slowly, disbelief flickering in his dark eyes—there was love, hatred, and an intense unwillingness to accept this fate.

"I'm sorry." As the woman choked out those words, the long-drawn-out war of vengeance came to an end. But the villain’s death did not mark the conclusion—it was only the beginning.

At this moment, the man who should have died was instead standing amidst a vast sea of stars. His black Taoist robe had been replaced by a form-fitting protective suit, and he was staring intently at the device on his wrist.

Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a watch but an advanced intelligent system.

His name was Zhou Yunsheng, originally from the high-tech world of the year 2458. As one of the most elite hackers of his time, he had been about to log off after completing a transaction in the star network when he was suddenly sucked into an entity resembling a black hole. He found himself in an alternate dimension known as the "Lord God's Space."

There, he was forcibly installed with a "Villain System" and embarked on a path of no return—one doomed to utter destruction.

He knew the rules well: Never touch the protagonist’s woman, never steal the protagonist’s treasures, never bully the protagonist’s subordinates, and never suppress the protagonist’s family.

Yet under the system’s control, he was forced to commit every foolish act imaginable, sprinting headlong down the road to ruin.

Even more maddening was the system’s interference every time he had a chance to kill the protagonist. Just as he was about to strike with a blade, sword, or gun, the system would flood his mind with a lengthy monologue to recite—signaling that someone was about to stab him in the back.

Zhou Yunsheng had a strikingly handsome appearance, his lips naturally curved in a way that made him seem gentle. But in reality, he was anything but. Cunning, adept at disguise, and possessing a near-obsessive need for control, he once treated the virtual world as a playground, manipulating data at will. Now, he had been reduced to nothing more than a pawn in the system’s game.

The sheer absurdity of it ignited a deep-seated rage within him.

He would have his revenge—on the Lord God itself.

A normal person might have sought clues across multiple reincarnations, slowly increasing their strength, and eventually exploring the Lord God's core to destroy it. But Zhou Yunsheng was a hacker—no one understood the nature of data better than he did.

Data could be the most orderly, precise, and unshakable machine in the world.

But it could also be the most chaotic, out-of-control, and fragile existence.

And the omnipotent Lord God, within this virtual realm, was nothing more than a set of data. To bring it down, he didn’t need an overwhelming force—he needed only a tiny glitch, a single line of corrupted code.

A virus.

From the very start, Zhou Yunsheng had planned to become a virus—a presence within the Lord God's system that it could neither detect, control, nor eliminate. Compared to the Lord God's vast central processor, he was merely a minor string of code.

But wherever that code passed, it would leave irreversible damage.

One day, all those damages would accumulate to a point where the entire system collapsed.

At that moment, whether he could return to his real world or not wouldn’t matter.

That future filled him with immense anticipation.

At present, Zhou Yunsheng was adjusting the device on his wrist—his "Villain System", granted by the Lord God. The system had its own identifier: 007.

It was highly emotional, with a voice modeled after a cutesy loli AI, designed to appeal to shut-in nerds. It assigned tasks issued by the Lord God, enforced punishments for failures, and could temporarily seize control of the host’s body—or even terminate the host if necessary.

Most people would have loathed such a system.

But not Zhou Yunsheng.

From the moment he received it, he had struggled to suppress his delight.

He was a hacker.

Give him a computer, and he could conquer the world.

And the Lord God had just handed him the perfect tool.

After countless cycles of reincarnation, today, when he completed yet another villain's task, he wasn’t sent back to the sterile white Lord God's space.

Instead, he arrived at this endless black void of stars.

And 007 was finally defeated, its program completely destroyed by the virus he had implanted long ago.

007 could no longer assign tasks. It could not speak. It could not take over his body.

It had been reduced to a mere instrument under his control.

Zhou Yunsheng adjusted the device with his fingertips, his starlit eyes brimming with amusement.

The galaxy before him was a secret space he had created through 007, a place where the Lord God’s omnipresent surveillance could not reach.

It was safe.

It was beautiful.

It was his sanctuary.

He strolled through the cosmos, picking up a dazzling star to inspect before gently returning it. This seemingly boundless universe was, in truth, reachable with just a thought.

Power, he realized, was not about strength.

It was about will.

Zhou Yunsheng chuckled softly, tapped his wrist, and vanished into the flickering starlight.

He couldn't wait to corrupt the Lord God’s perfect world.

When he opened his eyes again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself lying on an extravagant king-size bed.

Above him was a pristine white ceiling and a grand crystal chandelier.

Sitting up halfway, he glanced at his wrist, where the now silent AI device flickered on and off, displaying numerous lines of text—the detailed information he had just stolen from the Lord God’s system about his new body.

As a virus evading the Lord God's surveillance, Zhou Yunsheng naturally wouldn't possess a body tied to the main axis of the world—meaning, neither the protagonist nor heroine would suit him.

According to 007’s precise calculations, his best option was someone destined for deletion—

A cannon fodder.

Altering a cannon fodder's fate wouldn’t crash the alternate dimension, but it would disrupt the Lord God’s calculations.

A single data error could trigger a chain reaction of further errors.

By the time Zhou Yunsheng left, this world would already be beyond the Lord God’s control.

Like a necrotic gray zone in a brain—seemingly fine, yet already dead.

And when enough of these zones accumulated, the brain would inevitably collapse.

That was exactly what Zhou Yunsheng wanted.

A world beyond the Lord God’s grasp.

And this time, he was in control.

Chapter 1.2
Due to their excellent genes, the three sons of the Zhou family were all good-looking. However, since Zhou Wenjing was the protagonist, his appearance was naturally the most outstanding. His deeply defined, flawless features were like a masterpiece meticulously sculpted by God—perfect from every angle.

In comparison, Zhou Yunsheng’s features were slightly plainer, but his slightly upturned, starry peach blossom eyes made up for that minor shortcoming. When he looked at someone directly, it wasn't particularly striking, but when he turned his head slightly and cast a sidelong glance, the sharp and piercing quality of his gaze was enough to make anyone’s heart race.

As for Du Xulang, the novel's first male supporting character, his looks were on par with Zhou Wenjing’s—his chiseled face was flawless in its handsomeness. However, he kept his hair slightly long, just touching his ears, and wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, using his refined demeanor and friendly smile to conceal the unintentional dominance and sharpness that occasionally flashed through his brows.

On the surface, he was an elite returnee with a clean background, but in reality, he was the head of the Du financial conglomerate. Due to a past connection with Zhou Wenjing’s mother, he had deliberately returned to take care of her son. The Zhou family was also wealthy—considered an upper-class family in Country C—but compared to the Du family, which had established itself in Country J, they were insignificant. The difference between a corporation and a financial conglomerate was like the gap between heaven and earth.

In Country J, underground organizations were legal, and the Du family was the number one yakuza clan, with its arms business spanning the globe. A figure who should have been able to call the shots with a snap of his fingers was now serving as a personal assistant under Zhou’s father, being ordered around like a nanny. Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t understand what was going through his mind.

Was it all just because of a childhood memory? Perhaps Zhou Wenjing’s mother had been the only light in his dark world, and when she passed away, that light became eternal, naturally shifting onto Zhou Wenjing? By protecting Zhou Wenjing, was he also safeguarding the last shred of purity in himself?

No matter how ridiculous these speculations seemed, the fact was that Du Xulang had already come. Zhou Yunsheng saw no point in dwelling on it and instead picked up his cup, sipping his milk at a leisurely pace.

Zhou Yunsheng, Zhou Wenjing, and Du Xulang quietly ate their breakfast, while Zhou’s father and Zhou Wen’ang would occasionally chat and laugh between bites, making the atmosphere warm and harmonious. These two were the real father and son—everyone else was just extra. If Zhou Yunsheng had realized this sooner, he wouldn’t have ended up with such a tragic fate.

Thinking of this, Zhou Yunsheng curled his lips into a faintly mocking smile before casting a sidelong glance at Du Xulang, who happened to be looking up.

For a brief moment, the supposedly gentle and handsome youth exuded an unmistakable aura of mischief and danger. Du Xulang was visibly stunned, his heart skipping a beat. But when he looked again, the boy had already withdrawn his gaze, focusing solely on drinking his porridge.

After breakfast, as usual, Du Xulang drove the three young masters to school. No matter what he truly thought, he treated all three equally in public. However, due to Zhou Wen’ang’s outgoing personality, he appeared to be the closest to him.

Zhou Yunsheng closed his eyes to nap the moment he got into the car, while Zhou Wenjing remained silent. That left Zhou Wen’ang to chat with Du Xulang, seemingly concerned about Zhou’s father’s daily life but actually trying to pry into company affairs. As Zhou’s father’s most favored son, Du Xulang naturally answered every question without reservation.

High school life was dull. The overwhelming coursework was nothing but a trivial matter to a high-IQ hacker. Zhou Yunsheng slept through the first two periods and only woke up amid a commotion during the third.

As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw countless snowflakes drifting down outside the window.

It was almost summer—some of the girls in class had already switched to skirts—so how could it possibly be snowing?

Looking closer, he realized the "snowflakes" were actually shredded paper, cut into tiny fragments and dumped from the upper floors, creating an artificial snowfall. The sight was quite spectacular.

It was break time, and many students crowded onto the corridor to watch. Zhou Yunsheng was dragged outside by his close friend, who pointed at a figure standing amidst the paper snowflakes below. "We shredded all his textbooks to finally get justice for you and Wen’ang. A bastard should know his place. Trying to compete with you two? Utterly ridiculous!"

Only then did Zhou Yunsheng recall that Zhou Wenjing and Zhou Wen’ang were in the same third-year middle school class. A few days ago, they had argued over a girl who had sided with Zhou Wenjing, making Zhou Wen’ang lose face. As the school’s most influential figure, the original Zhou Yunsheng had ordered a lesson to be taught.

Shredding textbooks, splashing dirty water, verbal abuse, gang fights—these kinds of pranks had been happening to Zhou Wenjing constantly. Before Zhou Yunsheng took over this body, the conflict between them had already escalated beyond reconciliation.

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his gaze to the straight-backed, stubborn figure below. As if sensing it, the other boy looked up at the same moment. The former narrowed his eyes before flashing an unmistakably provocative smile, causing Zhou Wenjing to clench his fists and forcibly suppress his hatred.

If it were anyone else, knowing their future fate, the first thing they would do was try to repair their relationship with the protagonist and cling to the biggest golden thigh. But Zhou Yunsheng was too proud for that. With his exceptional intelligence and cunning, he had never learned to force himself to please others.

If he clung to the protagonist to change his fate, in the end, his destiny would still be controlled by the protagonist. How was that any different from being a puppet under the Main God? So, he had never planned to start with Zhou Wenjing.

Of course, he had also never considered eliminating Zhou Wenjing. As the protagonist, if Zhou Wenjing died, the entire world would collapse, alerting the Main God to abnormal data and leading to a search for him. Although the Star Ocean Space could shield him from detection, it would still be an inconvenience to his future plans, making every move risky. One mistake, and he’d be discovered.

A super AI like the Main God surely had built-in antivirus programs—Zhou Yunsheng had no desire to test them.

So, his current principle was to change the original host’s fate while causing data disorder without collapsing the world. As long as the protagonist remained, the world would remain. But it would no longer be the world calculated by the Main God—it would be unrecognizable.

After running through his plans once more in his mind, Zhou Yunsheng slowly retracted his gaze.

When one set their mind on idling away the days, time passed quickly. It felt like he had only closed his eyes for a moment before the day was already over. Zhou Yunsheng draped his school uniform jacket loosely over his shoulders, his black tie hanging slackly over his white shirt. Hands in his pockets, he strolled lazily toward the black business car parked by the roadside. His disheveled appearance somehow exuded a roguish charm, making many girls stop to admire him.

"Young Master Sheng, you’re quite popular at school. Do you have a girlfriend yet?" Du Xulang opened the car door for him, his smile carrying a hint of amusement.

Before the Main God threw him into an alternate dimension, Zhou Yunsheng had been a complete homosexual—naturally, he had no interest in women. But after loading the villain system, he had no choice but to compete with the protagonist for women, sometimes even doing things worse than an animal. God knew that even if a hundred beauties stripped in front of him in reality, he wouldn’t react.

Du Xulang’s teasing instantly triggered memories of being violated, making Zhou Yunsheng’s gentle smile vanish, replaced by a cold gaze that pierced straight into the other man’s eyes.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 1.3
Zhou Wenjing wanted to tear Zhou Yunsheng apart. Just as he was about to get up, he was kicked far away, coughing up a mouthful of blood.

The original host had been schemed against by Zhou Wen’ang, losing his status as the eldest son of the Zhou family along with his inheritance, causing his life to plummet into despair. At the same time, the protagonist, who had already become a business tycoon, added insult to injury, making it impossible for the original host to find a decent job for the rest of his life. In the end, he succumbed to depression and took his own life.

Having taken over the original host’s body and learned of his fate, Zhou Yunsheng had no intention of clinging to the protagonist’s thigh. The fact that he hadn’t immediately killed him was already an incredible display of restraint. If it weren’t for Du Xulang pressing down hard on his shoulder, he would have walked over and kicked him a few more times.

"Sheng Shao, do not mock the poor youth." A handsome young man adjusted his glasses, speaking as if in kind advice, yet his tone carried a hint of warning.

Zhou Yunsheng remained indifferent, brushing away the hand on his shoulder before leisurely strolling to Zhou Wenjing’s side. Zhou Wenjing was too injured to get up and could only glare at him with hatred.

"You hate me?" Zhou Yunsheng tilted his head.

In response, Zhou Wenjing spat out blood-tinged saliva.

Zhou Yunsheng sidestepped the spit and stepped on Zhou Wenjing’s chest with a sneer. "You actually hate me? What right do you have to hate me? Without my mother’s support, how could your mother, an orphan, have attended the best university in the country? How could she have gotten a high-paying job at Zhou Corporation straight after graduation? My mother treated her like her own daughter, and how did she repay that kindness? By climbing into my adoptive father’s bed? By bearing his child? Fine, she died. But why did she have to die in my mother’s bathtub? Was she atoning, or was she using her death to take revenge on my mother? Well, congratulations to her—she got what she wanted. My mother followed in her footsteps, leaving me all alone. Now tell me, who should I hate?"

As he spoke, Zhou Yunsheng's eyes grew redder, and he had to pause to take a deep breath. His hoarse voice was filled with such intense rage and hatred that it seemed capable of destroying everything in sight.

Zhou Wenjing was startled by his sudden emotional outburst and, for a moment, dared not meet his gaze. Even Du Xulang, who had initially wanted to pull Zhou Yunsheng away, felt his heart tighten slightly.

Before coming here, he had investigated Zhou Wenjing’s situation within the Zhou family and found him pitiful. But he had never considered things from Zhou Yunsheng’s perspective. Now, after hearing this accusation, he suddenly realized—the true victim in all this was Zhou Yunsheng’s mother. And the child abandoned by her, the one who had lost his mother so tragically, suffered just as much pain and hatred as Zhou Wenjing did.

A bastard child is pitiful. But what about the legitimate son? As an illegitimate child himself, Du Xulang had never thought about this question before.

The air was heavy with silence. Zhou Yunsheng, now calmer, slowly asked, "Search your conscience and ask yourself—if you were in my shoes, how would you feel?"

How would he feel? Pure, unrelenting hatred. Zhou Wenjing clenched his fists, his eyes filled with confusion.

Zhou Yunsheng suddenly lost interest. He removed his foot from Zhou Wenjing’s chest and sneered, "The person you should truly hate isn’t me—it’s Zhou Hao (Father Zhou). He is the real culprit behind your mother’s death." With that, he waved a hand at Du Xulang. "Let’s go."

"What about Jing Shao? Should we take him to the hospital?" Du Xulang asked with concern. He always maintained the image of a good-natured person and wasn’t afraid of arousing Zhou Yunsheng’s suspicion.

"He’s got thick skin. He won’t die," Zhou Yunsheng smirked, his gaze sharp as if seeing through everything, making Du Xulang’s breath hitch slightly.

The car slowly drove away, leaving Zhou Wenjing standing there, lost and alone. He still hated Zhou Yunsheng, but for the first time, his hatred for Father Zhou burned even stronger. In that moment, he swore—one day, he would destroy Zhou Hao and the Zhou family. As for Zhou Yunsheng, taking away everything he once prided himself on would be enough.

Du Xulang kept his eyes on the road, but in reality, his peripheral vision was subtly observing Zhou Yunsheng. His feelings toward the young man were complex—he found him hateful, yet pitiful, with a growing, indescribable sense of curiosity.

"Sheng Shao, although Jing Shao’s mother…" Du Xulang hesitated before continuing, "… wronged your mother, Jing Shao himself has done nothing wrong. Isn’t it a bit excessive to target him like this? There’s an old saying—leave some room for reconciliation. After all, you’re still brothers. You don’t have to make things so irreconcilable."

Before, he had even considered hiring someone to "train" this arrogant young master, but now he had abandoned the idea. Why bother picking a fight with a child who lost his mother at a young age?

Although the Du family wielded great power, even Du Xulang hadn’t been able to uncover the Zhou family’s darkest secret. That was because Zhou Hao had done an excellent job covering it up. He had buried the deceased child in his hometown, claiming him to be the mistress’s son. The mistress had played her role convincingly, weeping at the funeral as if she were heartbroken, fooling everyone. But fate was cruel, or perhaps Zhou Hao was simply cursed—just when she was about to become his legal wife, she was diagnosed with acute leukemia and died within months.

The truth had been buried. Other than Zhou Hao and Zhou Wen’ang, only Zhou Yunsheng, who had hacked into the mainframe system, knew the whole story.

"He did nothing wrong? Then am I the one at fault?" Zhou Yunsheng arched a brow, laughing coldly.

Du Xulang fell silent for a moment before adding, "Aren’t you afraid that if you keep pushing him, he’ll hate you? He’s still a son of the Zhou family and has a right to inherit. Right now, Chairman Zhou is in charge, so it doesn’t matter. But once he steps down, Jing Shao could easily cause trouble for you. Why make an enemy when you could make an ally?"

Normally, Du Xulang would never have spoken so frankly to Zhou Yunsheng. On the surface, Zhou Yunsheng was the rightful heir of the Zhou family, the most qualified to inherit Zhou Corporation. But Zhou Hao’s true intentions might not align with that. From an outsider’s perspective, Du Xulang could see clearly—Zhou Hao treated Zhou Wen’ang differently from his other two sons, indulging him to an absurd degree. If Zhou Wen’ang ever set his sights on the Zhou family’s fortune, Zhou Hao would support him without hesitation.

And Zhou Wen’ang, no doubt, already viewed Zhou Corporation as his own. Pity that Zhou Yunsheng still saw him as a "good brother," remaining utterly defenseless while being used to the fullest. If Zhou Wen’ang gained power, with his ruthless nature, even a legitimate brother like Zhou Yunsheng would meet a tragic end.

Realizing this, Du Xulang found himself looking at Zhou Yunsheng with an unexpected trace of sympathy. Among the three Zhou brothers, it was Zhou Yunsheng who was truly the most pitiful. Zhou Wenjing had his protection, Zhou Wen’ang had Zhou Hao’s favor, but Zhou Yunsheng? He had no one and was in a far more precarious position.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t care what Du Xulang was thinking. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t have cared. He chuckled before casually waving a hand. "I never intended to take over the Zhou family. Whether he hates me or not is irrelevant."

Du Xulang’s gaze flickered. "You don’t intend to take over the Zhou family? What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said," Zhou Yunsheng shot him a sidelong glance, then turned to look out the window, refusing to elaborate.

Zhou Wenjing didn’t return to the Zhou family estate until after 9 PM. As soon as he opened his door, he saw Du Xulang standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, smoking. His hair was neatly combed back, revealing sharp, striking features. He put out the cigarette and turned around, exuding an imposing presence that made Zhou Wenjing feel both fearful and admiring.

"Uncle, I’m back," Zhou Wenjing said, lowering his voice as he closed the door.

"How’s your injury?" Du Xulang asked.

"As soon as I got your message, Dr. Fang came over. My hand is fractured, but the rest are just minor injuries." Zhou Wenjing flexed his plastered left hand, gritting his teeth. "One day, I’ll crush the Zhou family beneath my feet. I’ll make Zhou Yunsheng pay for everything!"

Hearing him talk about taking down the Zhou family didn’t concern Du Xulang much, but that last part made him frown slightly. Yet, he said nothing.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 1.4
Although he couldn't wait for Zhou Yunsheng to get out of the country, Zhou Wen'ang still patiently said many words of persuasion. Only after confirming that the other party had made up his mind did he feign helplessness and compromise.

Once Zhou Wen'ang left, Zhou Yunsheng pulled up a document on his computer and sneered. It was a will amendment, with the signature of the original owner’s mother, Yang Xi. As a hacker, Zhou Yunsheng was accustomed to searching for information online. Though he knew the general direction of this world's development, he never overlooked hidden details.

This amendment was found in Yang Xi's email inbox, where she had reassigned the entire inheritance that originally belonged to Zhou Wen'ang to her eldest son. In other words, she intended to leave nothing for her younger son.

During her lifetime, Yang Xi was deeply influenced by Zhou’s father and was extremely partial to her younger son. Given this, it was highly unlikely she would treat him this way. Furthermore, this amended will was drafted just a week before her death, but before she could send it to her lawyer, it was permanently deleted. Soon after, she committed suicide by jumping into the sea.

Could such coincidences truly exist? Who deleted the will? Did she really commit suicide? Moreover, after her death, the lawyer still received a modified version of the will, which stated that all her assets would be left to her younger son, while the elder son would only inherit three villas and a few pieces of jewelry.

The original owner didn’t mind such an unfair inheritance distribution; in fact, he saw it as perfectly reasonable. However, Yang Xi’s parents found it inappropriate and personally came to inquire. At the time, Zhou’s father explained that the elder son would inherit the Zhou Corporation in the future, while the younger son was less capable, so it was better for him to have his mother's inheritance for support.

Yang Xi’s parents deeply loved their grandson and quickly accepted this reasoning. From then on, under Zhou’s father’s deliberate guidance, Zhou Yunsheng gradually distanced himself from his maternal grandparents. On the other hand, Zhou Wen'ang frequently visited them, gaining many benefits from the Yang family.

The original owner was foolish to such an extent—no wonder he died so pathetically. Zhou Yunsheng shook his head and locked the will away on his computer. Sooner or later, he would reclaim everything that rightfully belonged to the original owner.

Upon learning that Zhou Yunsheng was leaving the country, Zhou Wen'ang accelerated his efforts to drive Zhou Wenjing away. Once these two obstacles were removed, the Zhou Corporation would be his for the taking.

That day, Zhou Wenjing was expelled from school for allegedly stealing a classmate’s watch worth hundreds of thousands. The victim’s parents were influential figures and personally visited the Zhou family to have a serious discussion with Zhou’s father. Feeling utterly humiliated, Zhou’s father gave Zhou Wenjing a harsh beating with a belt before deciding to send him abroad.

"I didn't steal anything! It was Zhou Yunsheng who framed me! Uncle, you have to believe me!" Zhou Wenjing lay on his bed, his back covered in bruises. One hand was clenched into a fist while the other desperately gripped Du Xulang’s sleeve.

"I know you didn’t do it. Uncle believes you," Du Xulang reassured him, gently patting his head. Only when Zhou Wenjing fell asleep with tears in his eyes did he quietly leave the room. Standing at the door, he raised his hand but hesitated—he wasn’t sure why he had come in the first place.

He believed Zhou Wenjing was innocent, but he also knew this wasn’t Zhou Yunsheng’s doing.

Zhou Yunsheng indeed enjoyed tormenting Zhou Wenjing, whether by giving him a beating or issuing threats, but he had always been open and brazen about it, never afraid of being caught. Framing someone for theft and ruining their future? That was not his style. The only person capable of such a two-faced act was none other than Zhou Wen'ang.

Even though he understood this, Du Xulang had no intention of explaining it to Zhou Wenjing. Protecting him didn’t mean raising him in a greenhouse. He needed to learn to navigate hardships and eventually stand tall. People like Zhou Wen'ang—who appeared kind on the surface but plotted in the dark—were everywhere. Zhou Wenjing had to learn how to see through them.

Just as Du Xulang was about to leave quietly, the door swung open from inside. The young man leaned against the doorframe with his arms crossed.

"What? Here to fight for Zhou Wenjing?"

Du Xulang shook his head. Before he could respond, the young man turned slightly and motioned for him to come in. He had no choice but to follow.

"Sit." Zhou Yunsheng pointed at a single-seater sofa beside a floor lamp. The warm orange glow cast a cozy light over the velvet fabric, making the space feel inviting.

"Mind if I smoke?" Du Xulang crossed his long legs and pulled out a cigarette from his suit pocket. Having been in power for years, he never cared about such things, and asking was merely a courtesy. Besides, the room’s comfortable atmosphere had made him unconsciously lower his guard.

"I mind." Zhou Yunsheng walked over, plucked the cigarette from his lips, and tossed it into a steaming cup of milk. The sharp sizzle seemed to mock someone.

Du Xulang was momentarily stunned. Ever since taking over the Du Financial Group at twenty, no one had ever treated him like this. He suddenly found it amusing and chuckled as he rubbed his forehead.

Zhou Yunsheng ignored him, sat at his desk, and fiddled with his computer. Without looking up, he said, "I didn’t orchestrate Zhou Wenjing’s expulsion."

"I know it wasn’t you. I didn’t come here to question you." Du Xulang stopped laughing, his voice softening. He simply wanted to talk. Ever since that day in the dark alley, when the young man revealed his inner vulnerability, he had felt a strange sense of sympathy toward him. He couldn’t help but pay more attention.

Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him in surprise and, after a brief silence, said, "Then you should know who’s behind this. Let me tell you something—I’m leaving for abroad too. The day after tomorrow."

"Where to?" The man, who had been lounging lazily, suddenly straightened up.

"I'm going to Country A, just like Zhou Wenjing. But I’ll be studying at Hodgkiss Academy." Zhou Yunsheng lightly tapped his foot, swiveling his chair to face him. He said meaningfully, "You know, Country A has poor public safety and rampant drug problems. You’d better keep a close eye on Zhou Wenjing, or he might be led astray by certain people."

Du Xulang's heart wavered slightly, but his expression remained unchanged. He chuckled, "Once he’s abroad, he's on his own. What does that have to do with me? Why should I keep an eye on him?"

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t answer. Instead, he hit the Enter key, and a black-and-white photograph slowly appeared on the computer screen.

It showed a young girl, around fifteen or sixteen, sitting on the grass with a small boy of about four or five in her arms. The two of them squinted in the dappled sunlight, beaming with joy. The girl was unmistakably Zhou Wenjing’s late mother, and the boy’s delicate features bore an uncanny resemblance to Du Xulang.

The sight of this photo instantly brought back long-buried memories for Du Xulang. That had been the only time in his life he had felt warmth and happiness. But it had all ended with her death.

"Before the Smiths adopted you, you lived at Yupei Orphanage and were as close as siblings to Zhou Wenjing’s mother. They say an elder sister is like a mother—your bond must have been deep. So how could you possibly abandon your nephew?"

Though Zhou Yunsheng knew the truth, he wasn’t about to reveal everything—like Du Xulang’s real identity. His fabricated background as an adopted child of an American couple made it easier for him to reunite with Zhou Wenjing.

The only reason Zhou Yunsheng was saying all this was to clarify his neutral stance. Du Xulang was powerful, and if he chose to become an obstacle, it would make things unnecessarily difficult.

Du Xulang stared at the photo for a long time before sighing, finally taking a serious look at the young man before him. To uncover even this much despite his efforts to conceal the truth—this boy was anything but simple.



——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 1.5
In a dimly lit room, a thin young man lay bound to a four-poster bed, his entire body drenched in sticky sweat. His eye sockets were deeply sunken, and his skin had taken on the pallid, bluish-white hue characteristic of drug addiction. Having just endured a round of withdrawal symptoms, he now stared blankly at the canopy above, his gaze unfocused, lost in thought.

Steady footsteps approached. A tall man dressed in an iron-gray suit pushed open the door and walked to the bedside to inspect him. His jet-black hair was slicked back, revealing a strikingly handsome face. His long, narrow eyes gleamed with a dangerous glint, making him seem intimidating at a mere glance.

“I'll have the caregiver help you take a bath.” He pulled a handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wiped the cold sweat from the young man's forehead.

The young man licked his cracked, parched lips and rasped, “Uncle, it was Zhou Yunsheng who set me up. I remember now—I’ve seen that woman before. She was drinking with Zhou Yunsheng at Whiskey, and they looked very close. It must have been him who ordered her to frame me!”

This young man was Zhou Wenjing, currently a sophomore in college. A few months ago, he had gotten involved with a stunningly beautiful woman, never suspecting that she harbored ulterior motives. She had given him a cigarette laced with a highly addictive drug—one hit was all it took to get hooked. Despite his naturally suspicious nature and strong sense of self-preservation, Zhou Wenjing had a fatal weakness: his weakness for beautiful women. He never turned down an invitation from a pretty face.

By the time his first withdrawal symptoms struck, he realized what had happened, but it was already too late. Left with no choice, he had called his uncle, who was far away in J country.

Du Xulang tossed the damp handkerchief into the trash can, his heart boiling with rage—not because he blindly believed his nephew’s accusations, but because he was deeply disappointed in his incompetence. He had repeatedly warned him never to accept food or drinks from strangers and had even assigned bodyguards to follow him in secret.

But bodyguards weren’t full-time babysitters; they couldn’t interfere in their employer’s private affairs. If Zhou Wenjing wanted to fool around with women, they couldn’t forcibly stop him.

This was nothing short of self-destruction.

Suppressing his anger, Du Xulang washed his hands, then picked up the landline to call for a caregiver to come upstairs and bathe his nephew. Only after settling back onto the sofa did he speak in a deep voice, “This wasn’t Yunsheng’s doing. Think carefully—who else have you offended?”

He already knew who was behind this but had no intention of telling his nephew. If he couldn’t even identify his real enemies, he was doomed to be torn apart sooner or later. Du Xulang would guide him, help him when necessary, but he wouldn’t personally eliminate his enemies for him.

If he hadn't told himself years ago that his sister had been driven to her death by Yang Xi—leading her to commit suicide in Yang Xi’s bathtub—he might never have developed the urge to kill Zhou Yunsheng.

Hatred was contagious. His nephew despised Yang Xi and her son with all his being, so he never questioned anything and wholeheartedly aided him in seeking revenge. If not for Zhou Yunsheng’s scathing reprimands waking him up, Du Xulang might have become an ungrateful betrayer. Since then, his trust in his nephew’s words had significantly diminished.

“If not him, then who? Who else would benefit from my downfall?” Zhou Wenjing’s thin face twisted with resentment and unwillingness. He had long noticed his uncle’s growing fondness for Zhou Yunsheng—an inexplicable, almost obsessive attention.

Once, he had even discovered a stash of Zhou Yunsheng’s photos in his uncle’s bedside drawer. Judging by the angles, they were all taken in secret—each one a masterpiece, capturing the essence of his expressions with breathtaking clarity.

Although Zhou Yunsheng wasn’t as conventionally handsome as he was, his delicate, almost androgynous features held a strange, magnetic allure. His eyes, clear as the moon reflected on water, carried an undeniable charm. In one particular photo, where he glanced sideways at the camera with a slightly raised brow, it felt as if he could reach right into one’s chest and snatch away their heart.

The topmost photo was already slightly worn at the edges, a testament to how often it had been handled. Zhou Wenjing was convinced that if not for his presence, his uncle would have framed these photos and covered an entire wall with them.

He couldn’t understand where this fixation came from. Was it simply because his mother had once given his uncle a few clothes and toys when they were children? Du Xulang had left the orphanage at the age of five—how much kindness could he have received from her?

Even if his mother had financially supported Zhou Yunsheng’s mother, hadn’t she already repaid her debt with her life?

Yes, Zhou Wenjing had come to realize—it wasn’t Zhou Yunsheng’s mother who had driven his own mother to suicide. It was his mother who had driven Zhou Yunsheng’s mother to death.

At first, he had believed that his mother’s wrist-slitting death in Yang Xi’s bathtub was an act of revenge. But after Zhou Yunsheng’s furious outburst in a dark alley that day, he finally understood. His mother, so kind-hearted, must have felt guilty toward Yang Xi. Her death in Yang Xi’s bathtub was her way of saying: I have repaid everything I owed you.

But her thinking had been too naive, too short-sighted. She hadn’t realized that her death would indirectly lead to Yang Xi’s demise, which would, in turn, set their children on an irreversible path of hatred.

Even if he chose to spare Zhou Yunsheng, Zhou Yunsheng would never spare him.

Du Xulang frowned, displeased with his nephew’s stubbornness and extremism. He said in a heavy voice, “You can suspect anyone—except Yunsheng. If you really want to know who benefits, use your brain.”

Yunsheng? When did his uncle’s way of addressing him become so intimate?

Zhou Wenjing’s face darkened with jealousy. Seeing the sharp, icy look in his uncle’s eyes, he forced himself to think seriously. Then, an idea came to him—Zhou Wen’ang.

No, it couldn’t be Wen’ang. He was the only one in the Zhou family who had shown him kindness when he first arrived. He had secretly sent him medicine for his wounds, secretly celebrated his birthday, and even secretly accompanied him to visit his mother’s grave.

How could it be him?

His father had already made it clear—since Zhou Wen’ang had inherited Yang Xi’s estate, he had no claim to the Zhou Corporation.

They had no conflict of interest. Why would he want to harm him?

Zhou Wenjing shook his head, dismissing the thought. After racking his brain, he still believed Zhou Yunsheng was the culprit.

Seeing his nephew’s lack of insight, Du Xulang lost interest in continuing the conversation. When the caregiver arrived, he returned to his study and turned on the video call system.

A handsome yet weary face appeared on the screen, his eyes slightly reddened from lack of sleep.

“What do you want?”

“Still coding? It’s already 2:30 AM. Go to bed.” Du Xulang glanced at his watch, his seemingly casual tone carrying a hint of concern.

“Almost done.” Zhou Yunsheng tilted his head back and applied eye drops to soothe his dry eyes.

As he wiped away the excess moisture from his lashes, his slightly narrowed eyes shimmered like liquid gold, making Du Xulang’s breath hitch. He forced himself to lean back in his chair, crossing his long legs. Only after steadying his breathing did he say hoarsely, “Wenjing is in rehab. Do you know Elsa?”

Elsa—the woman who had lured Zhou Wenjing into addiction.

Zhou Yunsheng chuckled. “That idiot will die in a woman’s bed someday.”

Chapter 1.6

Zhou Yunsheng assumed that when two men found each other attractive, they would naturally move on to the next stage—casual hookups. However, Du Xulang’s approach was beyond his expectations.

The man seemed to be pursuing him, evolving from calling every three to five days to calling three to five times a day. Every time he came to Country A, he would insist on taking Zhou Yunsheng out for a meal—just a simple meal—maintaining a considerate yet not overly forward demeanor. During festive seasons, he even sent expensive gifts.

Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t help but shamelessly conclude—Du Xulang was courting him, and quite seriously at that. For someone who had always met a tragic end, forever hated by the male and female leads as the villain, this feeling was novel.

Every lifetime, he met a miserable fate. Every lifetime, he failed to find true love. Every lifetime, he was betrayed. Zhou Yunsheng thought he had become numb to the concept of “love.”

But it was only after breaking free from the system’s constraints that he realized he had merely buried his desires deep within. Since Du Xulang was sincere, he might as well go with the flow. Whether they could last in the long run was another matter altogether.

As he pondered, the phone on the table rang. Sure enough, the deep, magnetic voice of the man came through, “Do you like the watch I sent you? I bought the same model—it pairs well with many outfits...”

Kyoto, Japan

Du Xulang stood at the top floor of a skyscraper, speaking softly into the phone while leisurely smoking. Whatever was said on the other end made him chuckle, his eyes flashing with delight.

“Alright, I got it. See you next week—you pick the place.” He ended the call as he noticed his nephew entering without knocking, frowning slightly.

Zhou Wenjing discreetly studied him, curious about the person who could make his uncle so gentle.

“Uncle, have you found me an aunt?” he teased.

Du Xulang was clearly amused by the term “aunt.” He chuckled and nodded, “That’s right, I’ve found you an aunt.” Then, as if for his own amusement, he added, “Once I’ve won him over, I’ll introduce you two. You must get along well.”

Not won over yet? Zhou Wenjing quietly sighed in relief and obediently agreed.

He had learned the truth about Du Xulang’s real identity some time ago. At first, he found it unbelievable, then exciting, and finally, intimidating. It took him a year or two to gradually return to their original, relaxed way of interacting.

Under Du Xulang’s protection, he had founded his own company, which was now on the rise with a promising future. He was no longer the illegitimate son of the Zhou family who could be humiliated at will. In Japan’s business circles, even powerful tycoons now respectfully addressed him as “Young Master Jing.”

All of this was thanks to Du Xulang.

But if Du Xulang were to start his own family, would he still be as devoted to a nephew who wasn’t even related by blood? Would his wife and children accept his presence?

Zhou Wenjing was naturally suspicious and insecure. Even towards Du Xulang, who had given him everything without reservation, he held some degree of wariness.

The flicker in his gaze did not escape Du Xulang’s keen observation, and disappointment crept into his heart.

When Yunsheng learned about his true identity, he treated him no differently than before. In contrast, though his nephew tried to hide it, his fear and flattery still seeped through his words and actions.

There was a time when Du Xulang thought Yunsheng was inferior to his nephew. But now, he realized he had misjudged.

Zhou Wenjing felt a chill under his uncle’s scrutinizing gaze and quickly opened his laptop to change the subject. “Today is the final day of Business War. I want to take first place and show you.”

“Oh? It’s already the final day?” Du Xulang’s interest was piqued, and he walked over, focusing on the screen.

Business War was an online game released by Noah Universe, highly popular among business professionals. Its meticulous design and near-flawless realism had even led many industry giants to push their heirs into the game to hone their skills.

This year marked the second anniversary of Business War, and the developers hosted a true “business war” competition, allowing only players under 25 to participate.

The selected scenario was the Haicheng simulation. The competition lasted for 30 days, with each contestant starting with an initial capital of 10,000 yuan. When the countdown ended, the system would determine the winner based on comprehensive performance. Simply put, whoever made the most money won.

Zhou Wenjing was a devoted fan of Business War and a top-tier player. Up until now, he had been ranked number one. With a massive global player base, those who stood out were often exceptionally capable—and naturally, of exceptional backgrounds.

Many participants were second-generation heirs of financial conglomerates or self-made business prodigies. Even those competing anonymously were likely influential figures.

No one expected the illegitimate son of the Zhou family to dominate the rankings.

Meanwhile, Zhou Yunsheng had never appeared. Perhaps he was afraid of losing and embarrassing himself.

Feeling a surge of superiority, Zhou Wenjing pointed at the map and explained, “The land reclamation project between Shuangba Island and Qingshui Bay has been completed. This area will become a crucial commercial port, and the once-worthless Qingshui Warehouse will skyrocket in value, becoming a logistics hub. When the government first announced the project, I acquired Xinglong Group, which owns 20% of Qingshui Warehouse’s shares. That means I effectively control Qingshui Warehouse. I’ve secured the biggest piece of the pie in Haicheng.”

Du Xulang glanced at the screen, raising an eyebrow. “You seem a little too happy too soon. This player owns 22%—more than you.”

Following his uncle’s gaze, Zhou Wenjing saw a player named deicide posting a shareholding certificate in the chat, the glaring red “22%” stinging his eyes.

“What?! Where did this deicide come from? I’ve never seen him before!” Zhou Wenjing was shocked.

He immediately pulled up the player’s data and found that his overall performance seemed unremarkable. But after calculating each investment, he was stunned.

The player had invested across diverse industries—food, technology, real estate, entertainment—none of which yielded massive profits but were all steady earners. In just 29 days, he had quietly amassed a fortune.

His ranking sat precisely at 11th place—just below the threshold for public leaderboard visibility—allowing him to avoid detection.

Du Xulang studied deicide’s trade records and smirked. “Looks like he was thinking ahead. He started acquiring Qingshui Warehouse shares as soon as the government sent its first survey team to Qingshui Bay. Quite the late-game move.”

A strategic strike, waiting until the right moment to make an impact—it was unmistakably someone’s style. Du Xulang’s eyes gleamed with amusement.

Zhou Wenjing scoffed, “So what if he has 2% more than me? Xinglong Group specializes in real estate and finance, and I’ve maxed out my affinity with the chairman of Guomao Bank. One word from me, and the bank will cut off all financial services for deicide. Unless he wants to go bankrupt, he’ll have to sell his shares. In business, what’s in your hands doesn’t always belong to you.”

Du Xulang’s lips curled into a knowing smirk as he flicked the ash off his cigarette.

Zhou Wenjing quickly struck a deal with the bank chairman. But before he could celebrate, an unexpected move sent shockwaves through the competition—Shenghe Group, the second-ranked player, entered the fight for Qingshui Warehouse.

Shenghe Group dominated Haicheng’s shipping industry, and its real-world owner, Lei Shenghe, was the great-grandson of the world’s shipping tycoon, Lei Shizu...

Just as Zhou Wenjing prepared for battle, on the other side, Zhou Yunsheng tapped away at his keyboard, reaching an agreement with Lei Shenghe in a matter of minutes...
