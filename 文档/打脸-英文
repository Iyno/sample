Chapter 1.1

A man lay defeated on the ground, a chillingly cold sword pressed against his throat. His bloodstained eyes were filled with a bottomless hatred.

Standing before him was a man clad in a black Taoist robe. His features were undeniably handsome, yet the slight upward curve of his lips carried an unmistakable air of wickedness. Though his mind screamed, Kill him! Kill him now!, his sword-wielding hand remained motionless as he started rambling about the past—how he had destroyed the man’s family, slaughtered his parents and siblings, and tormented him over the years.

"Stop talking! If this goes on, I'll end up dead again!" The handsome man’s inner voice roared in frustration.

Just as he finally managed to force his body into motion and raised his sword for the killing blow, a woman—who should have been lying nearby on the verge of death—suddenly sprang up and drove a razor-sharp dagger deep into his back.

His eyes widened in disbelief as he slowly turned his head. Within his pitch-black pupils lay love, hatred, and an overwhelming unwillingness to accept his fate.

"I'm sorry." The woman’s choked voice marked the end of this long, drawn-out battle for revenge. But the villain’s death did not signify the conclusion of the story—it was only the beginning.

At this very moment, the man who was supposed to be dead found himself standing in a vast sea of stars. His black Taoist robe had been replaced by a form-fitting protective suit, and his gaze was fixed intently on the device strapped to his wrist.

Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a watch—it was an advanced AI system.

His name was Zhou Yunsheng.

Originally from the high-tech world of the year 2458, he had been one of the most elite hackers of his time. One day, after concluding a transaction on the Star Network and preparing to log out, he was unexpectedly sucked into a dimension known as the Lord God Space—a black hole-like existence beyond comprehension.

There, he was forcibly implanted with a Villain System, condemning him to a fate of endless destruction and miserable deaths.

He knew the rules well—he must never lay a finger on the protagonist’s woman, never steal the protagonist’s treasure, never bully the protagonist’s subordinates, and never suppress the protagonist’s family.

Yet, under the control of the system, he had no choice but to carry out these foolish actions, running headlong toward his demise.

What was even more maddening was that every time he had the perfect opportunity to end the protagonist’s life—with a knife, a sword, or a gun—the system would force him to recite a long monologue. And as soon as the words left his lips, without fail, someone would stab him in the back.

Inevitably.

Zhou Yunsheng possessed strikingly handsome features. Even when he wasn’t smiling, the natural curve of his lips gave the impression of a mild temperament. But the truth was quite the opposite—he was insidious, an expert in deception, and possessed an extreme desire for control.

For someone who had once treated data like a plaything, to become a mere pawn in a system’s game was an insult beyond measure. The stark contrast between his past omnipotence and his current helplessness awakened the deepest, most violent fury buried within him.

He wanted revenge. Revenge against the Lord God.

A normal person might have searched for clues across the endless cycles of transmigration, perhaps even cooperated with the system to gradually amass power and uncover the Lord God’s true form in hopes of destroying it.

But Zhou Yunsheng was a hacker.

No one understood the nature of data better than a hacker.

Data could be the most orderly, most precise, and most unshakable machine in existence.

Yet, it could also be the most chaotic, the most unstable, and the most fragile entity imaginable.

And in the end, the so-called omnipotent Lord God was nothing more than a set of data.

Destroying it didn’t require an overwhelming force—just a single, minuscule line of corrupt code.

A virus.

From the very start, Zhou Yunsheng had resolved to become that virus—an untraceable, uncontrollable, and indestructible virus lurking within the Lord God’s system.

Compared to the Lord God’s massive central processor, he was nothing but an insignificant strand of code.

But wherever this code passed, it would leave permanent damage.

And one day, those damages would accumulate to the point where they were enough to cripple the Lord God’s system.

By then, whether he could return to the real world or not would no longer matter.

He was already looking forward to that moment with great anticipation.

At present, Zhou Yunsheng was adjusting the AI device on his wrist—the very same Villain System the Lord God had implanted in him.

This system had its own designation: 007.

It was highly emotional, spoke in the kind of cute, loli-like voice adored by otaku men, and was responsible for assigning missions from the Lord God. It punished failures, temporarily seized control of its host’s body when necessary, and could even execute its host if deemed appropriate.

Any ordinary person would have loathed such a system to the core.

But not Zhou Yunsheng.

The moment he received this AI device, he had to suppress the overwhelming thrill and excitement surging through him.

He was a hacker.

All he needed was a computer, and he could conquer the world.

And the Lord God had just handed him the perfect tool.

After who-knew-how-many reincarnations, when he finally completed yet another villain’s script, instead of being transported back to the white expanse of the Lord God Space, he found himself standing in this endless sea of darkness.

And 007 had finally been broken—completely obliterated by the virus he had secretly implanted within it.

Just like it had once threatened him—it had been utterly erased.

007 could no longer issue missions.

It could no longer speak.

It could no longer control him.

It had been reduced to nothing more than a precision instrument, fully at his command.

Zhou Yunsheng slowly adjusted the AI device, a playful glint flashing through his star-filled eyes.

This vast and magnificent galaxy was a secret space he had created using 007, shielding himself from the Lord God’s omnipresent surveillance.

Here, he was safe.

Here, he was free.

He strolled through the Milky Way, picking up a radiant star, examining it closely, then gently placing it back.

The seemingly boundless universe was, in reality, just a thought away.

So this was what true power meant—not brute force, but willpower.

Zhou Yunsheng let out a soft chuckle, tapped his wrist, and vanished into the shimmering sea of stars.

He could hardly wait to taint the Lord God's perfect world.

When he opened his eyes again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself lying on an enormous king-size bed.

Above him was a pristine white ceiling adorned with a dazzling crystal chandelier.

He propped himself up slightly and glanced at the AI device bound to his soul.

Its screen flickered on and off, displaying lines of text—detailed information stolen from the Lord God’s system regarding his new body.

As a virus that had broken free of the Lord God’s surveillance, Zhou Yunsheng naturally wouldn’t attach himself to the focal points of the world—the protagonist and heroine.

Through 007’s precise calculations, the best choice was those destined to be erased.

The so-called cannon fodder.

Altering their fate wouldn’t cause the world to collapse, but it would introduce errors into the Lord God’s calculations.

And an error in a single data point could lead to a chain reaction of cascading failures.

By the time he left, this world would already be beyond the Lord God's control.

Just like gray areas in the human brain—seemingly intact, yet irreversibly necrotic.

And when those areas accumulated over time, the entire system would eventually crash.

That was the outcome Zhou Yunsheng desired the most.


After reading through the information, he curled his lips in amusement.

This body was sixteen years old this year and was also named Zhou Yunsheng—the eldest legitimate son of the Zhou family conglomerate. He was a high school freshman and had two younger brothers in their third year of middle school, both fifteen years old. One was named Zhou Wen'ang, and the other was Zhou Wen'jing.

On the surface, Zhou Wen'ang was Zhou Yunsheng’s biological brother, sharing the same parents. In reality, however, he was swapped at birth by Father Zhou, who took advantage of Mother Zhou’s weakness after childbirth to replace their real child with the son of his beloved mistress. Zhou Yunsheng’s true younger brother, born with a congenital heart defect, had died at birth.

Zhou Wen'jing, on the other hand, was the child of a university student sponsored by Mother Zhou. The woman was an orphan with a decent character, but guilt weighed on her. Not long after giving birth, she fell into depression and eventually committed suicide by slitting her wrists. It was Mother Zhou who discovered her body. Whether it was due to shock or something else, Mother Zhou jumped into the sea the following year, and her body was never found.

The protagonist of this world was none other than the third son of the Zhou family, Zhou Wen'jing. Oppressed by the family and persecuted by his brothers since childhood, he eventually turned the tables and rose to become a business tycoon. He defeated countless opponents and fought through one thrilling corporate battle after another, ultimately reaching the pinnacle of power and wealth. Meanwhile, Zhou Yunsheng was nothing more than a stumbling block on his path—not even qualified to be a true rival.

Among the three Zhou brothers, the eldest was steady and experienced, the second was pure and straightforward, and the third was reclusive and aloof. On the surface, the eldest seemed to be the most outstanding and shrewd, yet he was, in fact, the most foolish. He treated Zhou Wen'ang as his real brother, caring for and yielding to him in all matters. Under his father’s deliberate guidance, he was led to ostracize and suppress Zhou Wen'jing, completely ignoring the obvious favoritism shown by his father. Eventually, he became nothing more than a shield, absorbing risks for Zhou Wen'ang.

In the end, he not only made an enemy of Zhou Wen'jing and suffered retaliation, but even his share of the family inheritance was schemed away by Zhou Wen'ang. Destitute and ruined, he spent the rest of his life in misery until he died in despair.

A textbook example of a cannon fodder character.

After finishing the information, Zhou Yunsheng stretched lazily and walked toward the massive floor-to-ceiling window, basking in the morning sunlight. His mind, as precise as a 007 supercomputer, was already calculating how to change the fate of the original body.

Since he was here, he would take life seriously. He wouldn't treat this world as a mere illusion or approach it with the detached attitude of playing a game.

This was a world created by the Supreme God, a vast collection of data, an alternate dimension separate from reality. However, he himself was also a string of data—or rather, a soul existing in the form of code. There was no fundamental difference between them.

The rage and heartbreak of betrayal, the agony of being killed over and over again—these pains were no less real than in the real world. In fact, because these memories were imprinted deep within his soul, they were even more profound.

He no longer wanted to be a puppet manipulated by the Supreme God. Since he had arrived, he would do everything in his power to overturn his fate and carve out his own existence.

At this moment, the sunlight was momentarily veiled by the clouds, and the smooth glass reflected the young man’s strikingly handsome yet sharp and determined face.

"Young Master Sheng, breakfast is ready. Time to get up."

Right then, the housekeeper knocked on the door.

Zhou Yunsheng withdrew his sharpness, replacing it with a warm and elegant smile. Following the original owner's habits, he changed into his school uniform and went downstairs after a quick wash.

In the dining room, Father Zhou sat at the head of the table, reading a newspaper. Zhou Wen'ang leaned on his shoulder, stretching his neck to read along. When Father Zhou was about to turn the page, Zhou Wen'ang quickly pressed the newspaper down with one hand, whining that he hadn't finished yet.

Father Zhou chuckled helplessly and pinched his son's nose affectionately.

Such warmth—had Zhou Yunsheng, the legitimate eldest son, ever received it?

Yet, under Father Zhou’s brainwashing, he had always believed that the best of everything should be given to his younger brother, that taking care of him was his responsibility.

Take care of him?

The current Zhou Yunsheng would indeed take very good care of Zhou Wen'ang. The corners of his lips curled up, making his smile appear even gentler and more sincere. He took the seat to Father Zhou’s left, casually glancing at Zhou Wen'jing, who sat with his head lowered, lost in thought.

"Young Master Sheng, a glass of milk every morning."

Father Zhou’s personal assistant, Du Xulang, walked out of the kitchen, placing a steaming cup of milk in front of him—effectively cutting off his line of sight toward Zhou Wen'jing.

Zhou Yunsheng's smile deepened, but a sharp glint flashed across his dark eyes.

He had almost forgotten—this household not only sheltered the protagonist Zhou Wen'jing but also the first male supporting lead, Du Xulang.
Without him, Zhou Wen'jing wouldn't have been able to rise to dominance ten years later, reigning supreme over the business world.

To put it more bluntly—Du Xulang was Zhou Wen'jing’s greatest god, an existence as overpowered as a game-breaking buff.




_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 1.2

Thanks to their excellent genes, the three sons of the Zhou family were all good-looking. However, as the protagonist, Zhou Wenjing naturally stood out with his appearance. His face was deep and flawless, like a masterpiece carefully sculpted by God, perfect from every angle.

In comparison, Zhou Yunsheng's features were a bit more ordinary. However, his eyes, like stars, slightly upturned at the corners, made up for this slight gap. When he looked at people directly, it didn’t seem much, but when he turned his head and glanced sideways, his gaze, sharp like a hook, could make anyone's heart race.

As the first male supporting character, Du Xulang's appearance was on par with Zhou Wenjing's. His chiseled face was strikingly handsome. But with his ear-length tousled hair and gold-rimmed glasses, he masked the dominance and sharpness in his expression with graceful gestures and a friendly smile.

On the surface, he was an overseas-educated elite with a clean family background. In reality, he was the leader of the Du family conglomerate. Due to his childhood connection with Zhou Wenjing's mother, he returned to the country to look after the son of an old friend. The Zhou family was wealthy, ranking among the top in C country, but compared to the Du family's fortune, they were insignificant. The difference between a conglomerate and a family business was vast.

In J country, organized crime was legal, and the Du family was the top gangster family with a global arms trade. A person who should have been commanding the world, yet here he was, working as a personal assistant under Zhou's father, treated like a servant, which made Zhou Yunsheng unable to understand his true thoughts.

Was it because of a childhood memory? Perhaps Zhou Wenjing’s mother was his only light in the dark world. After she died, that light never extinguished and naturally shifted to Zhou Wenjing? Was he protecting Zhou Wenjing as he would protect the last piece of his pure world?

No matter how ridiculous and absurd these guesses were, the truth was that he had already arrived. Zhou Yunsheng stopped delving further and leisurely drank his milk.

The three of them—Zhou Yunsheng, Zhou Wenjing, and Du Xulang—ate in silence, while Zhou's father and Zhou Wen'ang exchanged a few words between bites, creating a warm and harmonious atmosphere. These two were the true father and son, while the others were just extra characters. If Zhou Yunsheng had realized this sooner, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a tragic fate.

Thinking about this, Zhou Yunsheng tugged at the corner of his mouth, revealing a sarcastic smile, then glanced sideways at Du Xulang, who had just looked up.

The usually refined and handsome young man instantly turned into a figure full of arrogance and provocation, which clearly took Du Xulang by surprise. His heart skipped a beat. When he looked back again, the young man had already turned his gaze away, focusing on his porridge.

After breakfast, Du Xulang, as usual, took the three sons to school. No matter what he thought inside, he treated them all equally in front of others. However, since Zhou Wen'ang, the second son, was the most lively and cheerful, he appeared to be the closest to him.

Zhou Yunsheng immediately closed his eyes and pretended to nap as he got in the car. Zhou Wenjing remained silent, and Zhou Wen'ang, therefore, had to talk to Du Xulang, seemingly asking about Zhou's father's daily life but actually subtly probing into company matters. Du Xulang, naturally, answered every question without hesitation, showing no signs of wariness.

High school life was boring, and the mountain of homework was no challenge for a highly intelligent hacker. Zhou Yunsheng slept through the first two classes and only woke up in the third when the noise from the classroom reached his ears. Upon opening his eyes, he saw snowflakes falling outside the window.

It was almost summer, and the girls in class were already wearing skirts. How could it be snowing?

Upon closer inspection, Zhou Yunsheng realized the "snow" was actually shredded paper falling from the upper floors, creating an artificial snowstorm. It was quite a spectacle. At that moment, the class break had started, and many students crowded the hallway to watch. Zhou Yunsheng was dragged out by his close friends, who pointed at a figure standing in the snow below and said, "Cut up all his textbooks! Finally, this will give you and Wen'ang some satisfaction. A bastard child should know his place. Thinking he could compete with you and Wen'ang, he’s simply out of his mind."

Zhou Yunsheng then remembered that Zhou Wenjing and Zhou Wen'ang were both in the third year of middle school and in the same class. A few days ago, they had a disagreement over a girl, who kept defending Zhou Wenjing, making Zhou Wen'ang lose face. As the most influential figure in the school, the original Zhou Yunsheng had declared that he would teach Zhou Wenjing a lesson.

Shredded textbooks, dirt, insults, group fights—such pranks were constantly carried out against Zhou Wenjing. By the time Zhou Yunsheng had taken over, the conflict between the original Zhou Yunsheng and Zhou Wenjing had escalated to an irreconcilable point.

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his head and stared at the tall, stubborn figure, who happened to look up. Zhou Yunsheng squinted and suddenly gave a provocative smile, which made the other person clench his fists tightly, struggling to suppress his hatred.

If it were someone else, knowing their future fate, the first thing they would do would be to repair their relationship with the protagonist to try to latch onto the biggest source of power. But Zhou Yunsheng was an extremely proud person. His supreme intelligence and sharp methods made it impossible for him to ever force himself to flatter others.

Relying on the protagonist to change the original fate would still mean that his life was controlled by the protagonist, which was no different from being a puppet of the main god. Therefore, he never thought about starting with Zhou Wenjing.

Of course, he also never considered eliminating Zhou Wenjing. As the protagonist, if Zhou Wenjing died, this world would collapse, and the main god would notice the data anomaly and trace him. Although the Starry Sea Space could block the main god's search, it would still be detrimental to his future plans, making it difficult to act without concerns. One wrong move, and the main god might discover him.

With a super-intelligent entity like the main god, it surely had antivirus programs installed, and Zhou Yunsheng had no intention of testing them.

So, his current guiding principle was to change the original fate without causing a collapse of the world. As long as the protagonist remained, the world would continue, but it would no longer be the same. It would no longer be the version that the main god had calculated.

After going over all his plans in his mind, Zhou Yunsheng slowly withdrew his gaze.
Having been living life aimlessly, time always passes quickly. It feels like a whole day has gone by with just a blink of the eyes. Zhou Yunsheng, with his school uniform jacket open and a black tie loosely hanging on his white shirt, hands in his pockets, walked leisurely toward the business car parked by the roadside. His seemingly careless appearance, however, exuded an air of refined arrogance, which attracted many girls to stop and watch.

"Young Master Sheng, you’re quite popular at school. Do you have a girlfriend?" Du Xulang opened the car door for him, his smile tinged with a hint of teasing.

Before being transported to another dimension by the System, Zhou Yunsheng was a thorough-going homosexual and naturally had no interest in women. But after the villain system took over, he was forced to compete for women with the protagonist and sometimes even had to do unspeakable things to women. Heaven knows that, even if a hundred beauties stood before him stripping, he wouldn’t feel the slightest arousal.

Du Xulang's playful words momentarily reminded him of the nauseating feeling of being violated, and his usually gentle smile faded, replaced by a cold, sharp gaze that pierced through Du Xulang’s eyes.

Du Xulang had never taken the Zhou brothers, Zhou Yunsheng and Zhou Wenang, seriously. Especially Zhou Yunsheng, who was nothing but a complete fool, manipulated by Zhou Wenang without even realizing it. But that sharp look he just showed instantly shattered Du Xulang's impression of him.

This was not the look of a young man who was all show and easily trusting.

However, before Du Xulang could think any further, Zhou Yunsheng lowered his eyes and spoke indifferently, "Let's go, no need to wait. Wenang’s last class is P.E., and he finished early, 20 minutes ahead of schedule."

Du Xulang nodded, started the car, and drove off. They passed through a dark alley, and Zhou Yunsheng suddenly spoke up, "Pull over here, I need to do something."

The car slowed and parked by the roadside, but Zhou Yunsheng didn’t get out. Instead, he rolled down the window, resting his chin on his hand, smiling as he looked into the alley.

On both sides of the alley, towering skyscrapers blocked the light, making the place quite dark. A few large trash bins emitted a foul odor, attracting many stray cats and dogs. Suddenly, there was a dull thud, and a dark figure crashed into a trash bin, then awkwardly fell to the ground. A wild cat hiding inside the bin let out a scream and quickly ran off.

Du Xulang's expression subtly changed when he saw the face of the person, and he immediately moved to get out of the car to help. But Zhou Yunsheng held him back with a firm grip on his shoulder.

"He won’t die," Zhou Yunsheng said lazily, applying subtle pressure on Du Xulang's shoulder.

Du Xulang reluctantly withdrew his hand from the door handle and forced a smile.

Zhou Wenjing seemed to want to fight back. Before he could even get up, a tall man stepped on his back and stamped on him a few times. Several young men with colorful hair gathered around, ransacked his belongings, kicked him, and left after threatening him, laughing as they walked away.

Scenes like this were common in the bustling, noisy city and hardly evoked any sympathy from passersby. Zhou Yunsheng, the one who initiated this, smiled with satisfaction.

Yes, these people were hired by the original Zhou Yunsheng to give Zhou Wenjing a lesson—neither too big nor too small. With the memories of the original host now in his mind, Zhou Yunsheng was determined to go ahead with this plan. Not only was he here to watch the show, but he also brought the protagonist’s bodyguard along.

Du Xulang adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, concealing the frost building up in his eyes. The eldest son of the Zhou family sure loved to court death.

Zhou Wenjing struggled to get up, nearly falling again when he bent down to pick up his bag. Du Xulang secretly gripped the steering wheel tighter. After several attempts, he finally managed to grab his bag. He stood up, spat out a bloody phlegm into the trash bin, and walked out expressionlessly. As soon as he saw Zhou Yunsheng’s gentle smile in the car, his face instantly contorted with fury.

"It’s you!" His voice was full of hatred, the words squeezed through gritted teeth.

"Yes, it’s me," Zhou Yunsheng nodded nonchalantly.

Zhou Wenjing could no longer hold back and charged toward Zhou Yunsheng, ready to throw a punch. But the car door suddenly swung open, slamming into him, and he collapsed onto the ground, unable to get up for a while.

Zhou Yunsheng walked slowly over to him, slightly bent down, and gave him a mockingly appraising look, as if surveying a clown. Du Xulang followed closely behind, 
ready to intervene in case Zhou Yunsheng decided to take further action.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Chapter 1.3

Zhou Wenjing felt like he could tear Zhou Yunsheng apart with his bare hands. Just as he was about to get up, Zhou Yunsheng kicked him far away, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The original host had been schemed against by Zhou Wen'ang, losing his position as the heir of the Zhou family and all his wealth, his life falling into a deep abyss. At the time, the protagonist, already a business tycoon, added insult to injury, making it impossible for the original host to find a decent job for the rest of his life, eventually succumbing to depression and ending his life.

After taking over the original host's body and learning of his fate, Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t even consider trying to get close to the protagonist. He felt that if he didn’t kill him immediately, it was already a sign of self-control. If it weren’t for Du Xulang forcibly holding him back, he would have gone over to kick him a few more times.

“Sheng Shao, don’t bully the poor youth,” the handsome young man adjusted his glasses, sounding half-serious, half-warning.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t care and brushed off the hand on his shoulder. He slowly walked over to Zhou Wenjing. Zhou Wenjing, unable to get up, could only stare at him with hateful eyes.

“You hate me?” Zhou Yunsheng tilted his head.

In response, Zhou Wenjing spat out a mouthful of blood-tainted saliva.

Zhou Yunsheng sidestepped, stepped on Zhou Wenjing's chest with one foot, and coldly sneered, "You hate me? What right do you have to hate me? Without my mother's help, your mom, an orphan, wouldn't have been able to attend the best university in the country. Why could she start working at Zhou's right after graduation, earning hundreds of thousands a year? My mother treated her like a daughter, but how did she repay her? She slept with her adoptive father? Had children with him? It's fine that she died, but why did she have to die in my mother's bathtub? Was she atoning, or was she using her life to get back at my mother? Well, she got what she wanted. My mother followed in her footsteps, leaving me all alone. You tell me, who should I hate?”

The more he spoke, the redder Zhou Yunsheng's eyes became, forcing him to stop and take a deep breath. His hoarse voice was filled with intense anger and hatred, as if he wanted to destroy everything in front of him.

Zhou Wenjing was shocked by the sudden outburst and didn’t dare to meet his gaze. Du Xulang, who had been about to pull Zhou Yunsheng away, felt a slight tremor in his heart.

Before coming, he had investigated Zhou Wenjing's situation in the Zhou family and felt pity for him. However, he hadn’t looked at it from Zhou Yunsheng's perspective. After hearing Zhou Yunsheng’s accusations, he suddenly realized that the biggest victim was actually Zhou Yunsheng's mother. The pain and hatred of this abandoned child were no less than those of Zhou Wenjing.

The illegitimate child might be pitied, but what about the legitimate child? As another illegitimate child, Du Xulang had never considered this before.

The air hung heavy for a moment before Zhou Yunsheng slowly regained his composure and asked, “Tell me, if you were me, what would you feel?”

What would he feel? Of course, it would be hatred—immense hatred. Zhou Wenjing secretly clenched his fists, confusion in his eyes.

Zhou Yunsheng suddenly found the whole situation boring. He moved his foot from Zhou Wenjing’s chest, coldly laughed, and said, “The one you should hate most is not me, but Zhou Hao (Zhou's father). He’s the one who killed your mother.” He waved at Du Xulang. “Let’s go.”

“What about Wenjing? Should we send him to the hospital?” Du Xulang asked, his concern evident. He had always presented himself as a nice guy and wasn’t worried that Zhou Yunsheng would become suspicious.

“He’s tough; he won’t die,” Zhou Yunsheng said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. His piercing gaze made Du Xulang feel slightly breathless.

The car slowly drove away, leaving Zhou Wenjing standing in confusion and loneliness. He still hated Zhou Yunsheng, but his hatred for Zhou Hao had grown stronger than ever. In that moment, he silently swore that one day, he would destroy Zhou Hao and the Zhou family. As for Zhou Yunsheng, it was enough to make him lose everything he had once been proud of.

Du Xulang seemed to be focused on the road, but in reality, he was discreetly studying Zhou Yunsheng out of the corner of his eye. At that moment, he felt mixed emotions towards the young man—he found him hateful, but also pitiful, with a bit of inexplicable curiosity.

“Sheng Shao, although Wenjing’s mother…” He paused ever so slightly before continuing, “...apologized to your mother, but Wenjing didn’t do anything wrong. You’re constantly targeting him. Isn’t that a bit too much? As the saying goes, leave a line in life for future encounters. After all, he’s your brother. Don’t push things to an irreversible point.”

If it were any other time, he wouldn’t have spoken such blunt words to Zhou Yunsheng. Despite Zhou Yunsheng being the rightful heir to the Zhou family and the most qualified to inherit Zhou’s group, Zhou Hao might not necessarily think so. Zhou Yunsheng was oblivious to this, but as an outsider, Du Xulang could see it clearly. Zhou Hao’s attitude toward Zhou Wen'ang was completely different from how he treated the other two brothers—he was almost doting to the point of being shameless. If Zhou Wen'ang ever intended to take over Zhou's, Zhou Hao would never oppose it.

As for Zhou Wenjing, he probably already viewed the Zhou family as his own property. It was a pity that Zhou Yunsheng still considered him a good brother, completely unguarded, and being used to the fullest. If Zhou Wen'ang rose to power, with his cold-hearted nature, even though they were brothers by blood, Zhou Yunsheng’s life would likely be difficult, and he would never know when he would be betrayed.

With that thought, Du Xulang’s gaze toward Zhou Yunsheng carried a subtle trace of sympathy. Looking at it this way, Zhou Yunsheng seemed to be the most pitiful of the Zhou brothers. Zhou Wenjing had his protector, Zhou Wen'ang had Zhou Hao, but Zhou Yunsheng was all alone, in a precarious situation.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t know what Du Xulang was thinking, nor would he care if he did. He chuckled before waving his hand, saying, “I never planned to inherit the Zhou family. Why should I care if he hates me?”

Du Xulang’s eyes flickered, and he asked, “Not planning to inherit the Zhou family? What do you mean, Sheng Shao?”

“Just what it says,” Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him sideways, then turned his gaze to the window and stopped speaking.

Zhou Wenjing didn't return to the Zhou family until after 9 PM. As soon as he opened the door, he saw Du Xulang standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, smoking a cigarette. His scattered bangs were neatly combed back, revealing his handsome and sharp facial features. He extinguished the cigarette and turned to look at Zhou Wenjing, whose strong, natural aura made Zhou Wenjing feel both afraid and, more so, a sense of admiration.

"Uncle, I'm back," he immediately closed the door behind him and lowered his voice. He didn't know Du Xulang's true identity—he only knew that the man was a friend of his mother’s from the orphanage, as close as siblings, and had returned specifically to take care of him. However, due to his powerful presence and extraordinary capabilities, Zhou Wenjing was aware that Du Xulang was no ordinary person.

"How are your injuries?" Du Xulang asked, extinguishing his cigarette.

"As soon as I received your message, Dr. Fang came. My hand is fractured, the rest are just some superficial wounds." Zhou Wenjing shook his left hand, which was in a cast, gritting his teeth as he said, "One day, I'll trample the Zhou family underfoot, and make Zhou Yuncheng pay for everything that happened today!"

Du Xulang didn't think much of his plan to deal with the Zhou family, but at the last sentence, he furrowed his brows, though he didn't say anything.

Meanwhile, Zhou Wenang knocked on Zhou Yuncheng's door.

"Elder brother, did you have someone hurt that bastard? You truly are my real elder brother," Zhou Wenang affectionately draped his arm over Zhou Yuncheng’s shoulder.

"Yes, I had someone do it." Zhou Yuncheng subtly pulled away, walking over to the desk to fiddle with his computer. A series of codes rapidly appeared and disappeared on the dark screen, lighting up his face intermittently.

"Elder brother, that bastard is truly a nuisance. You should think of a way to send him abroad, preferably never to return."

The ideas for tormenting Zhou Wenjing always came from Zhou Wenang, and Zhou Yuncheng would carry them out. All the hatred was directed at Zhou Yuncheng, while Zhou Wenang played the good guy behind the scenes, offering Zhou Wenjing small favors. As a result, although Zhou Wenjing’s relationship with Zhou Wenang wasn’t close, it wasn’t bad either. Even if Zhou Wenjing were to take over the Zhou family, Zhou Wenang would still be a member of the board, living a comfortable life.

This kind of situation had happened before. Not only did Zhou Wenang urge Zhou Yuncheng to send Zhou Wenjing abroad, but he also bribed several drug dealers to get Zhou Wenjing hooked on drugs. If Du Xulang hadn't arrived in time and forced him to quit, Zhou Wenjing’s life would have been ruined.

All the retribution was taken by Zhou Yuncheng, while the real villain, Zhou Wenang, rode on the coattails of the protagonist, living a smooth life. What kind of world was this?

Zhou Yuncheng sneered inwardly and, staring at the computer screen, said淡ly, "You figure it out yourself. I've been busy recently."

"What are you busy with?" This was the first time his elder brother had refused him, and Zhou Wenang couldn't help but frown.

"I'm applying to study abroad. I've already selected the school, and the application is in progress. Dad doesn’t know yet. Once the application is approved, I'll talk to him. You must keep it a secret for me." Zhou Yuncheng pressed the Enter key, and the computer screen showed a student application form for Hockisky High School in Connecticut, USA, stamped with an initial approval, waiting for final approval in a week.

Hockisky High School was one of the best secondary schools in the U.S., with strict admission requirements and was often referred to as the "Little Ivy League." Every year, countless people applied, but only a few made it through the approval process.

A flash of jealousy appeared in Zhou Wenang’s eyes but quickly subsided. Compared to getting rid of Zhou Wenjing, what he truly wanted was to get rid of Zhou Yuncheng. Now, Zhou Yuncheng had chosen to leave on his own, which saved him a lot of effort. When Zhou Yuncheng returned, it was uncertain who would be in charge of the Zhou family.

Moreover, the security in the U.S. was poor, and every year, a few international students went missing for no apparent reason. He wondered if Zhou Yuncheng would be one of those unlucky souls.

Chapter 1.4

Although Zhou Wen'ang was eager for Zhou Yunsheng to leave the country immediately, he patiently said many words of persuasion until he was sure of the other's determination, then reluctantly agreed.

After Zhou Wen'ang left, Zhou Yunsheng pulled up a document on his computer and smirked coldly. It was a will amendment, signed by Yang Xi, the original host's mother. As a hacker, searching for information online was always Zhou Yunsheng's habit. Although he knew the general direction of this world's development, he wouldn't overlook any hidden details.

This amendment was found in Yang Xi's email, which transferred all the inheritance originally meant for Zhou Wen'ang to the eldest son. In other words, she didn't intend to leave a single penny for her younger son.

Yang Xi, influenced by Zhou's father, had always favored her younger son. Under normal circumstances, she would never have treated him this way. Moreover, this amended will was drafted a week before her death, but it was deleted before it could be sent to the lawyer, and she committed suicide by jumping into the sea shortly after.

How could such a coincidence exist? Who deleted the will? Was her death truly a suicide? After her death, the lawyer still received an amended will, which stated that all her property would go to the younger son, while the eldest son only received three villas and some jewelry.

The original host didn't mind this unfair distribution of inheritance, even finding it natural. However, Yang Xi's parents felt uneasy and personally came to inquire. At that time, Zhou's father explained that the eldest son would inherit the Zhou family business, while the younger son was less capable and needed the inheritance to support himself.

Yang Xi's parents, who dearly loved their grandson, quickly accepted this explanation. From then on, under Zhou's father's deliberate guidance, Zhou Yunsheng distanced himself from his maternal grandparents, while Zhou Wen'ang frequently visited them, gaining many benefits from the Yang family.

The original host was so foolish that it's no wonder he died so miserably. Zhou Yunsheng shook his head and locked the will in his computer. Sooner or later, he would reclaim everything that belonged to the original host.

After learning that Zhou Yunsheng planned to go abroad, Zhou Wen'ang accelerated his efforts to force Zhou Wenjing out. With these two obstacles removed, the Zhou Group would fall into his hands.

One day, Zhou Wenjing was expelled from school for allegedly stealing a classmate's luxury watch worth hundreds of thousands. The victim's parents, who were influential figures, personally visited the Zhou family to speak with Zhou's father. Feeling deeply humiliated, Zhou's father beat Zhou Wenjing with a belt after the guests left and decided to send him abroad.

"I didn't steal anything! Zhou Yunsheng framed me! Uncle, you have to believe me!" Zhou Wenjing lay on the bed, his back covered in wounds, clutching Du Xulang's sleeve tightly with one hand.

"I know you didn't do it. I believe you," Du Xulang patted his head soothingly. After Zhou Wenjing fell asleep with tears in his eyes, Du Xulang quietly went to the boy's room, raising his hand but unsure why he had come. He believed Zhou Wenjing was innocent, but he also knew that Zhou Yunsheng wasn't behind this.

Zhou Yunsheng enjoyed tormenting Zhou Wenjing, whether through beatings or threats, always doing so openly without fear of being discovered. Framing someone and ruining their future wasn't his style. The one who would do such a thing was the deceitful Zhou Wen'ang.

Although Du Xulang understood this, he didn't plan to explain it to Zhou Wenjing. Protecting him didn't mean shielding him from all hardships. He wanted Zhou Wenjing to experience the storms of life and grow into a strong individual. The world was full of hypocrites like Zhou Wen'ang, and Zhou Wenjing needed to learn to recognize them.

As Du Xulang was about to leave quietly, the door opened, and the boy stood there, arms crossed, leaning against the doorframe.

"What? Here to seek justice for Zhou Wenjing?"

Du Xulang shook his head, but before he could explain, the boy stepped aside, gesturing for him to come in. He had no choice but to follow.

"Take a seat," Zhou Yunsheng pointed to a single armchair beside a floor lamp, its warm orange glow creating a cozy atmosphere.

"Do you mind if I smoke?" Du Xulang crossed his long legs and took out a cigarette from his suit pocket, lighting it. Accustomed to being in power, he rarely cared about others' opinions, but he asked out of politeness. The boy's room was so warm and comfortable that he couldn't help but relax.

"I do mind," Zhou Yunsheng walked over, took the cigarette from his mouth, and threw it into a steaming cup of milk. The sizzling sound seemed to mock someone.

Du Xulang was stunned. Since he took over the Du family conglomerate at twenty, no one had dared to treat him like this. He found it amusing and chuckled softly.

Zhou Yunsheng ignored him, sitting down at his desk and fiddling with his computer. Without looking up, he said, "Zhou Wenjing's expulsion wasn't my doing."

"I know it wasn't you. I didn't come here to accuse you," Du Xulang stopped laughing and explained gently. He just wanted to talk to the boy. Ever since the boy revealed his vulnerability in the dark alley that day, Du Xulang had felt a sense of pity for him and couldn't help but pay more attention.

Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him in surprise, then said after a moment of silence, "Then you should know who's behind this. Let me tell you, I'm also planning to go abroad, leaving the day after tomorrow."

"Where to?" The man, who had been lounging casually, suddenly straightened his back.

"To Country A, like Zhou Wenjing. But I'll be attending Hodgkins Academy," Zhou Yunsheng spun his chair around to face the man, adding meaningfully, "You know how bad the security is in Country A, with rampant drug problems. You'd better keep a close eye on Zhou Wenjing, lest someone lead him astray."

Du Xulang's heart stirred, but his expression remained unchanged. He smiled and asked, "Once he's abroad, Zhou Wenjing will have to fend for himself. What does that have to do with me? Why should I keep an eye on him?"

Zhou Yunsheng didn't answer. Instead, he pressed the enter key, and a black-and-white photo slowly appeared on the computer screen. It showed a teenage girl sitting on the grass, holding a four or five-year-old boy in her arms. Both were smiling brightly in the dappled sunlight. The girl was unmistakably Zhou Wenjing's deceased mother, and the boy's features bore a striking resemblance to Du Xulang.

The photo instantly brought back long-buried memories for Du Xulang, memories of the only warmth and happiness he had ever experienced. But all of that had ended with the death of his loved one.

"Before you were adopted by the Smiths, you stayed at Yupei Orphanage, where you were as close as siblings with Zhou Wenjing's mother. They say an elder sister is like a mother, so your feelings for her must have been deep. How could you abandon her son?"

Although Zhou Yunsheng knew everything, he didn't plan to reveal all the truths, such as Du Xulang's real identity. His fabricated identity was that of a child adopted by an A-country couple from C-country, which also made it easier for him to recognize Zhou Wenjing.

The reason Zhou Yunsheng told Du Xulang so much today was to clarify his neutral stance. Du Xulang had immense influence, and if he decided to make things difficult, Zhou Yunsheng would find himself in a tough spot.

As for the protagonist, he was still weak now. By the time he grew stronger, Zhou Yunsheng believed he would also have become powerful enough to be unshakable. Having lived through hundreds or even thousands of lifetimes, his greatest asset was stored in his brilliant mind. The technology in this world wasn't backward, but it wasn't advanced either, far from the world he originally came from, let alone the interstellar era he had experienced in his reincarnations.

By writing a few programs and developing some software, he could amass a vast fortune in a short time. He possessed wisdom, so no matter how dire the situation, he could remain calm. But if he could avoid trouble and obstacles, that would be even better.

Du Xulang stared at the photo for a long time before sighing and finally taking the young man before him seriously. To uncover even a hint of the truth despite his efforts to conceal it, this young man was anything but ordinary.

Zhou Yunsheng gave him a sarcastic smile. "Do you remember? Every holiday, you and your sister would receive new clothes and toys from a certain Ms. Yang. That Ms. Yang was my mother, Yang Xi." He had played the villain long enough and decided that in every subsequent life, he would stand on the moral high ground. Although Yang Xi might not have been driven to death by Zhou Wenjing's mother but rather murdered by Zhou Hao, why should he tell this man? Making him feel guilty and thus more accommodating better served his ultimate interests.

Du Xulang was completely stunned. It took him a long while to finally say in a hoarse voice, "I'm sorry, I forgot." He was only five at the time and was soon taken back by the Du family, so he didn't have a deep impression of Ms. Yang, who had never shown her face.

After he left, Ms. Yang continued to support his sister, allowing her to escape the harsh environment of the orphanage, attend the best university in C-country, and secure a job at the Zhou Corporation.

This was a life-changing kindness, but how did his sister repay it? She destroyed her benefactor's family and indirectly caused her death. Even worse, he himself had never cared for the benefactor's child and had even considered eliminating him to pave the way for Zhou Wenjing, all because Zhou Wenjing had told him that his sister had been driven to death by Yang Xi.

What a complete inversion of right and wrong, repaying kindness with enmity. Du Xulang wiped his face, not daring to think further.

"No need to apologize. She didn't care for your gratitude. There are plenty of ungrateful people in the world; who hasn't encountered a few?" Zhou Yunsheng stood up, opened the door, and said, "It's late. You should go. Don't forget to take the milk with you."

Du Xulang smiled bitterly, picked up the cup of milk with the cigarette butt floating in it, and left with heavy steps. He tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep.

The two Zhou brothers went abroad one after the other, one attending the prestigious Hodgkins Academy, a small Ivy League school, and the other attending the elite Repton School. Not long after, Du Xulang, Zhou's father's personal assistant, resigned and disappeared without a trace.

A year and a half later, a storm swept through the IT world. A tech company called Noah Universe developed a Star Wars online game that became a global sensation within a month of its beta release. Its exclusive sensory helmet provided players with an immersive experience, ushering in a new era of online gaming.

With this game and the sensory helmet, Noah Universe quickly amassed a huge fortune and went public on NASDAQ the following year, becoming a dark horse in the IT industry with immense potential.

The technology contained in the sensory helmet was so advanced that no one could decipher it. Countless IT giants wanted to poach the computer genius behind Noah Universe but couldn't even find out who it was.
