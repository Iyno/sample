Chapter 1.1
A man was knocked to the ground, a chilling sword pressed against his throat. His bloodstained eyes were filled with bottomless hatred.

Opposite him stood a man clad in a black Taoist robe. His handsome face exuded charm, yet the slight upward curve of his lips carried an overwhelming sense of wickedness. He screamed inwardly, "Kill him! Kill him!" but his hand holding the sword remained still. Instead, he began to ramble, recounting the past—how he annihilated the man's family, slaughtered his parents and siblings, and tormented him over the years.

"Enough nonsense! If you keep talking, you'll be the one dying next!" The handsome man's inner voice roared.

When he finally regained control and raised his sword to strike, the woman who should have been lying nearby, barely clinging to life, suddenly sprang up. A dagger, sharp enough to slice through iron like butter, plunged into his back.

He turned his head slowly, disbelief flickering in his dark eyes—there was love, hatred, and an intense unwillingness to accept this fate.

"I'm sorry." As the woman choked out those words, the long-drawn-out war of vengeance came to an end. But the villain’s death did not mark the conclusion—it was only the beginning.

At this moment, the man who should have died was instead standing amidst a vast sea of stars. His black Taoist robe had been replaced by a form-fitting protective suit, and he was staring intently at the device on his wrist.

Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a watch but an advanced intelligent system.

His name was Zhou Yunsheng, originally from the high-tech world of the year 2458. As one of the most elite hackers of his time, he had been about to log off after completing a transaction in the star network when he was suddenly sucked into an entity resembling a black hole. He found himself in an alternate dimension known as the "Lord God's Space."

There, he was forcibly installed with a "Villain System" and embarked on a path of no return—one doomed to utter destruction.

He knew the rules well: Never touch the protagonist’s woman, never steal the protagonist’s treasures, never bully the protagonist’s subordinates, and never suppress the protagonist’s family.

Yet under the system’s control, he was forced to commit every foolish act imaginable, sprinting headlong down the road to ruin.

Even more maddening was the system’s interference every time he had a chance to kill the protagonist. Just as he was about to strike with a blade, sword, or gun, the system would flood his mind with a lengthy monologue to recite—signaling that someone was about to stab him in the back.

Zhou Yunsheng had a strikingly handsome appearance, his lips naturally curved in a way that made him seem gentle. But in reality, he was anything but. Cunning, adept at disguise, and possessing a near-obsessive need for control, he once treated the virtual world as a playground, manipulating data at will. Now, he had been reduced to nothing more than a pawn in the system’s game.

The sheer absurdity of it ignited a deep-seated rage within him.

He would have his revenge—on the Lord God itself.

A normal person might have sought clues across multiple reincarnations, slowly increasing their strength, and eventually exploring the Lord God's core to destroy it. But Zhou Yunsheng was a hacker—no one understood the nature of data better than he did.

Data could be the most orderly, precise, and unshakable machine in the world.

But it could also be the most chaotic, out-of-control, and fragile existence.

And the omnipotent Lord God, within this virtual realm, was nothing more than a set of data. To bring it down, he didn’t need an overwhelming force—he needed only a tiny glitch, a single line of corrupted code.

A virus.

From the very start, Zhou Yunsheng had planned to become a virus—a presence within the Lord God's system that it could neither detect, control, nor eliminate. Compared to the Lord God's vast central processor, he was merely a minor string of code.

But wherever that code passed, it would leave irreversible damage.

One day, all those damages would accumulate to a point where the entire system collapsed.

At that moment, whether he could return to his real world or not wouldn’t matter.

That future filled him with immense anticipation.

At present, Zhou Yunsheng was adjusting the device on his wrist—his "Villain System", granted by the Lord God. The system had its own identifier: 007.

It was highly emotional, with a voice modeled after a cutesy loli AI, designed to appeal to shut-in nerds. It assigned tasks issued by the Lord God, enforced punishments for failures, and could temporarily seize control of the host’s body—or even terminate the host if necessary.

Most people would have loathed such a system.

But not Zhou Yunsheng.

From the moment he received it, he had struggled to suppress his delight.

He was a hacker.

Give him a computer, and he could conquer the world.

And the Lord God had just handed him the perfect tool.

After countless cycles of reincarnation, today, when he completed yet another villain's task, he wasn’t sent back to the sterile white Lord God's space.

Instead, he arrived at this endless black void of stars.

And 007 was finally defeated, its program completely destroyed by the virus he had implanted long ago.

007 could no longer assign tasks. It could not speak. It could not take over his body.

It had been reduced to a mere instrument under his control.

Zhou Yunsheng adjusted the device with his fingertips, his starlit eyes brimming with amusement.

The galaxy before him was a secret space he had created through 007, a place where the Lord God’s omnipresent surveillance could not reach.

It was safe.

It was beautiful.

It was his sanctuary.

He strolled through the cosmos, picking up a dazzling star to inspect before gently returning it. This seemingly boundless universe was, in truth, reachable with just a thought.

Power, he realized, was not about strength.

It was about will.

Zhou Yunsheng chuckled softly, tapped his wrist, and vanished into the flickering starlight.

He couldn't wait to corrupt the Lord God’s perfect world.

When he opened his eyes again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself lying on an extravagant king-size bed.

Above him was a pristine white ceiling and a grand crystal chandelier.

Sitting up halfway, he glanced at his wrist, where the now silent AI device flickered on and off, displaying numerous lines of text—the detailed information he had just stolen from the Lord God’s system about his new body.

As a virus evading the Lord God's surveillance, Zhou Yunsheng naturally wouldn't possess a body tied to the main axis of the world—meaning, neither the protagonist nor heroine would suit him.

According to 007’s precise calculations, his best option was someone destined for deletion—

A cannon fodder.

Altering a cannon fodder's fate wouldn’t crash the alternate dimension, but it would disrupt the Lord God’s calculations.

A single data error could trigger a chain reaction of further errors.

By the time Zhou Yunsheng left, this world would already be beyond the Lord God’s control.

Like a necrotic gray zone in a brain—seemingly fine, yet already dead.

And when enough of these zones accumulated, the brain would inevitably collapse.

That was exactly what Zhou Yunsheng wanted.

A world beyond the Lord God’s grasp.

And this time, he was in control.
