Chapter 1.11

When Du Xulang was one year old, his mother abandoned him at the doorstep of an orphanage. He was too young to remember much, not even the woman's appearance. He didn't know who his father was, and the only things the woman left him were a name and a black raven tattooed on her left shoulder.

It wasn’t until later that he learned this raven was the symbol of the largest Yakuza syndicate in J country, the Du family conglomerate.

The orphanage was not a good place. There was never enough food, yet the number of abandoned children kept increasing. They would often fight over a cold bun, breaking each other’s bones in the process. From one to five years old, his body was always covered in scars, his stomach was always empty, and his heart was filled with darkness.

But in this place of endless gloom, there was one ray of sunshine that kept him going, making him grit his teeth and survive each day. That person was Fang Nianyou, ten years older than him, who gave him meticulous care. Even when she was hungry, she would save the last bite of food for him. Du Xulang didn’t know what it was like to be loved by a mother, but with Fang Nianyou around, he thought he had experienced it.

In the final year at the orphanage, a woman named Yang donated a large sum of money and brought new clothes and toys for all the orphans on New Year's Eve. Fang Nianyou received a pink cotton jacket, and she spun around in front of him, filled with gratitude for Ms. Yang.

Du Xulang received a Transformer toy, something he had longed for. He had even thought about stealing money from the headmaster to buy one. Now someone had given it to him, and he was overjoyed, almost always hugging it to sleep.

Not long after, people from the Du family came to take him to J country. He thought this would be the beginning of a happy life, but little did he know, he was stepping straight into hell. The incompetent Du family heirs had only one way out: death. His brothers tore at each other like wild dogs, fighting for the only chance of survival.

During countless cold and bloody nights, Fang Nianyou's smile became ever more vivid, while the toy he once cherished was forgotten in the corner.

When he finally secured the position of head of the Du family, he had a moment to breathe and decided to leave all his duties behind to go to C country and find his family.

He found Fang Nianyou’s son, Zhou Wenjing, in a filthy, chaotic clinic. He had been beaten, his nose bone was injured, and his eyes, once dark and full of hope, were now filled with shadow and despair.

Fang Nianyou was someone who could smile even in adversity. How could her son have become like this? Du Xulang was furious. But as Zhou Wenjing explained, his anger turned into overwhelming bitterness.

He hadn’t expected that Fang Nianyou didn’t die of depression or suicide, but was forced to death, drowned in someone’s bathtub. He didn’t need to see it with his own eyes to imagine the blood-soaked, tragic scene.

The Zhou family was truly overbearing!

He didn’t try to persuade his nephew to leave with him. Since the Zhou family treated him so harshly, he would help his nephew take everything from the Zhou family. With malice and a mocking attitude, he concealed his identity and applied for a job with the Zhou family. He quickly earned Zhou Hao’s trust.

As a personal assistant, he gained access to the Zhou family and began secretly observing the other two sons of the Zhou family. Zhou Yunsheng, the eldest son, appeared calm and always ranked top in his studies. Zhou Wen'ang, the youngest son, was two months younger than Wenjing, lively and cheerful, and very much favored by Zhou Hao.

Wenjing had a good relationship with Zhou Wen'ang, but with Zhou Yunsheng, it was like water and fire. But to Du Xulang, neither of the Zhou brothers was impressive. One was clumsy with his methods, and the other was two-faced with flattery. Neither had great wisdom, just petty cleverness. On the other hand, Wenjing was strong, resilient, and smart—he had potential.

Du Xulang decided to sculpt this raw gem into a brilliant masterpiece. During the process, Zhou Yunsheng’s repeated provocations irritated him. Perhaps he should teach this child a lesson.

But this child unexpectedly gave him a wake-up call. If not for his harsh scolding, if not for his deep hatred, Du Xulang might never have realized that Fang Nianyou’s death wasn’t a revenge plot but an act of atonement. He had always remembered Fang Nianyou with her gentle smile. She was kind and good; how could she have been a vengeful ghost, covered in blood and hatred?

It seemed he had misunderstood the cause and effect, and he had made a huge mistake. It wasn’t until that moment that he connected the woman who gave him the New Year’s gift, Ms. Yang, with Zhou Yunsheng’s mother. He had investigated the Zhou family, and he should have known this clearly, yet it was as if a fog had clouded his eyes, making him see nothing but hatred.

But as Zhou Yunsheng said, what right did he and Wenjing have to hate anyone? The one he should have hated all along was himself.

Perhaps out of guilt, or perhaps to make amends, Du Xulang started sincerely caring for Zhou Yunsheng and kept a close eye on everything about him. Slowly, he learned about Zhou Yunsheng’s dislikes—how he hated carrots, liked to rub his wrist when bored, was very skilled with computers, and always drank a glass of milk before bed…

He knew every small detail and habit in his life, but he ignored how this attention would affect him in the end.

In the end, Wenjing was betrayed by Zhou Wen'ang, but he poured his hatred onto Yunsheng. Du Xulang was very displeased with this. The more he focused on Yunsheng, the more he saw the restraint and strength hidden beneath his impulsive personality. In contrast, Wenjing seemed ordinary, unable to distinguish his true enemies—how would he ever be able to stand on his own in the future?

Du Xulang didn’t enlighten him. Only those who have fallen can learn to overcome obstacles. He left Wenjing’s room and, inexplicably, found himself standing at Yunsheng’s door. The separation was imminent, and yet, he felt an unexpected reluctance.

Just when Du Xulang thought he had understood the young man well enough, he would always bring him an even greater surprise. He discovered the hidden relationship between Zhou Yunsheng and Wenjing’s mother, which indirectly showed him Yunsheng’s exceptional skills and his indifferent attitude toward personal interests.

  Compared to the still-evolving Wen Jing, he is ready to shine. Du Xulang is filled with anticipation for his future, a stronger expectation than he ever had for cultivating Wen Jing.

He sent a few bodyguards to secretly protect him, instructing them to send updates and photos of his movements every week. His attention to him gradually became a habit. On his birthday, when he returned to the empty, silent room smelling of overpowering perfume and alcohol, he unexpectedly found a photo of Yun Cheng in his email inbox.

The boy was holding a chocolate cone, licking the sweet cream with his tongue. It seemed like he had noticed someone was spying, and his narrow peach-shaped eyes glanced sideways, his lazy gaze carrying a hint of vigilance. The captivating charm pierced Du Xulang's chest through the computer screen, causing his breath to quicken.

He stared at the screen for a long time, before finally calling the boy.

"Are you free? Want to video chat with me?" he repeated, desperately hoping to see him face-to-face.

The boy agreed, and when he learned it was Du Xulang's birthday, he thought for a moment, then opened the music box on his desk. Using a lot of rivets, screws, and other parts, he quickly assembled a Transformer. It only took half an hour.

His expression was so focused, and his nimble fingers seemed capable of creating another splendid world. Du Xulang found himself lost in a daze, only snapping back when the screen went dark after being idle for too long.

The boy, meticulous as always, seemed to notice that Du Xulang liked the gift. The next day, it arrived at the company via express delivery. Du Xulang couldn't help but smile as he unwrapped it, playing with it for a long time before carefully placing it on his desk. Before leaving work, he carefully put it in his briefcase to take home. Initially, he placed it on the bookshelf, not wanting to see it at a glance, but later moved it to the desk. Before bed, after some thought, he finally placed it on the bedside table.

This was the second toy he had ever received in his life, but it was his first birthday gift. He couldn't put it down.

His contact with the boy gradually increased. Whenever he had free time, he would dial the video call, eagerly waiting for the boy's handsome face to appear on the other end. The boy was very busy, and even when returning his call, he was programming. If the other side didn't speak, he would immerse himself in his own world, forgetting everything around him.

In order to see him more often, Du Xulang would intentionally remain silent, then gaze at the boy's serious profile for hours without tiring. Sometimes, this intense stare would be interrupted by an assistant or secretary, but when he returned after handling work, he would find the boy still sitting there quietly, his fingers nimbly tapping on the keyboard.

It seemed like the boy would always be standing there waiting for him. Du Xulang's heart skipped a beat at this sudden thought.

But gradually, things began to slip out of his control. He would find himself restless at the mere glance of a slender waist, long legs, or a blurred, shadowy figure. It would disturb his sleep, and even when he finally managed to fall asleep, he would awaken to a sense of overwhelming desire that would leave him in a daze, his body and mind trembling in sync.

Flipping through the photos he had collected over the years, he almost immediately began his pursuit. From initially testing the waters to becoming increasingly serious and cautious, and finally to carefully cherishing this obsession, he had fallen into the pit of love, unable to escape, yet unable to resist.

At the heavy security prison in Country C,

Zhou Wenjing sat at the visitation window, anxiously smoking. A patrolling prison guard walked over, sternly ordering him to put out the cigarette. He was reminded of how Zhou Yunsheng also used an authoritative tone to order his uncle to put out his cigarette, and his uncle would always comply, his expression a mix of subtle helplessness and deep satisfaction.

It was clear that he enjoyed being controlled by Zhou Yunsheng.

Zhou Wenjing stubbed out the cigarette with a sneer.

Just then, a gaunt man with a grey complexion, under the guard of a prison officer, sat down. If not for the nameplate on his chest reading "Zhou Wenang," Zhou Wenjing would hardly have recognized this person as the once confident third son of the Zhou family.

"How have you been recently?" Zhou Wenjing asked in a calm voice. The other side remained silent, so he continued, "Today, Zhou Yunsheng and Du Xulang are getting married. You should see the news report in a few days."

Finally, there was a response from the other side, and the man cried out, "Wenjing, tell my older brother to let me out! I know I was wrong. If he lets me out, I'll even be willing to serve him as a horse for the things I did back then. Wenjing, please help me. I can't take it anymore. They're not even human. They're torturing me with everything they’ve got..."

Zhou Wenjing lost patience and growled, "Is this how you give up? Is this how you surrender? Zhou Wenang, you’re pathetic!"

He threw the receiver down and hurriedly walked out of the prison. The suffocating weight in his chest only grew heavier instead of dissipating. These years had been tough for him. Without Du Xulang's protection, he no longer had that feeling of invincibility in the business world. On the contrary, his bad relationship with Zhou Yunsheng had led to ridicule, exclusion, and oppression.

He had considered fighting back, but clashing with a giant like the Noah Group was like trying to hit a rock with an egg, not to mention that behind them stood the Du family’s business empire. A few days ago, he attempted to bid for a project with a subsidiary of Noah, but before the bidding meeting, his secretary had sold the bid to a rival company. Even before the fight began, he had already lost.

He had never felt so small, so powerless. The words he had just said to Zhou Wenang were not just an accusation towards him, but an accusation against himself. Throughout his life, he would never catch up to Zhou Yunsheng's footsteps.

Somehow, he had a feeling—he shouldn't be so weak. He should have been standing at the same height as Zhou Yunsheng. He couldn’t understand what went wrong in this world.
