Chapter 1.1

A man lay defeated on the ground, a chillingly cold sword pressed against his throat. His bloodstained eyes were filled with a bottomless hatred.

Standing before him was a man clad in a black Taoist robe. His features were undeniably handsome, yet the slight upward curve of his lips carried an unmistakable air of wickedness. Though his mind screamed, Kill him! Kill him now!, his sword-wielding hand remained motionless as he started rambling about the past—how he had destroyed the man’s family, slaughtered his parents and siblings, and tormented him over the years.

"Stop talking! If this goes on, I'll end up dead again!" The handsome man’s inner voice roared in frustration.

Just as he finally managed to force his body into motion and raised his sword for the killing blow, a woman—who should have been lying nearby on the verge of death—suddenly sprang up and drove a razor-sharp dagger deep into his back.

His eyes widened in disbelief as he slowly turned his head. Within his pitch-black pupils lay love, hatred, and an overwhelming unwillingness to accept his fate.

"I'm sorry." The woman’s choked voice marked the end of this long, drawn-out battle for revenge. But the villain’s death did not signify the conclusion of the story—it was only the beginning.

At this very moment, the man who was supposed to be dead found himself standing in a vast sea of stars. His black Taoist robe had been replaced by a form-fitting protective suit, and his gaze was fixed intently on the device strapped to his wrist.

Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a watch—it was an advanced AI system.

His name was Zhou Yunsheng.

Originally from the high-tech world of the year 2458, he had been one of the most elite hackers of his time. One day, after concluding a transaction on the Star Network and preparing to log out, he was unexpectedly sucked into a dimension known as the Lord God Space—a black hole-like existence beyond comprehension.

There, he was forcibly implanted with a Villain System, condemning him to a fate of endless destruction and miserable deaths.

He knew the rules well—he must never lay a finger on the protagonist’s woman, never steal the protagonist’s treasure, never bully the protagonist’s subordinates, and never suppress the protagonist’s family.

Yet, under the control of the system, he had no choice but to carry out these foolish actions, running headlong toward his demise.

What was even more maddening was that every time he had the perfect opportunity to end the protagonist’s life—with a knife, a sword, or a gun—the system would force him to recite a long monologue. And as soon as the words left his lips, without fail, someone would stab him in the back.

Inevitably.

Zhou Yunsheng possessed strikingly handsome features. Even when he wasn’t smiling, the natural curve of his lips gave the impression of a mild temperament. But the truth was quite the opposite—he was insidious, an expert in deception, and possessed an extreme desire for control.

For someone who had once treated data like a plaything, to become a mere pawn in a system’s game was an insult beyond measure. The stark contrast between his past omnipotence and his current helplessness awakened the deepest, most violent fury buried within him.

He wanted revenge. Revenge against the Lord God.

A normal person might have searched for clues across the endless cycles of transmigration, perhaps even cooperated with the system to gradually amass power and uncover the Lord God’s true form in hopes of destroying it.

But Zhou Yunsheng was a hacker.

No one understood the nature of data better than a hacker.

Data could be the most orderly, most precise, and most unshakable machine in existence.

Yet, it could also be the most chaotic, the most unstable, and the most fragile entity imaginable.

And in the end, the so-called omnipotent Lord God was nothing more than a set of data.

Destroying it didn’t require an overwhelming force—just a single, minuscule line of corrupt code.

A virus.

From the very start, Zhou Yunsheng had resolved to become that virus—an untraceable, uncontrollable, and indestructible virus lurking within the Lord God’s system.

Compared to the Lord God’s massive central processor, he was nothing but an insignificant strand of code.

But wherever this code passed, it would leave permanent damage.

And one day, those damages would accumulate to the point where they were enough to cripple the Lord God’s system.

By then, whether he could return to the real world or not would no longer matter.

He was already looking forward to that moment with great anticipation.

At present, Zhou Yunsheng was adjusting the AI device on his wrist—the very same Villain System the Lord God had implanted in him.

This system had its own designation: 007.

It was highly emotional, spoke in the kind of cute, loli-like voice adored by otaku men, and was responsible for assigning missions from the Lord God. It punished failures, temporarily seized control of its host’s body when necessary, and could even execute its host if deemed appropriate.

Any ordinary person would have loathed such a system to the core.

But not Zhou Yunsheng.

The moment he received this AI device, he had to suppress the overwhelming thrill and excitement surging through him.

He was a hacker.

All he needed was a computer, and he could conquer the world.

And the Lord God had just handed him the perfect tool.

After who-knew-how-many reincarnations, when he finally completed yet another villain’s script, instead of being transported back to the white expanse of the Lord God Space, he found himself standing in this endless sea of darkness.

And 007 had finally been broken—completely obliterated by the virus he had secretly implanted within it.

Just like it had once threatened him—it had been utterly erased.

007 could no longer issue missions.

It could no longer speak.

It could no longer control him.

It had been reduced to nothing more than a precision instrument, fully at his command.

Zhou Yunsheng slowly adjusted the AI device, a playful glint flashing through his star-filled eyes.

This vast and magnificent galaxy was a secret space he had created using 007, shielding himself from the Lord God’s omnipresent surveillance.

Here, he was safe.

Here, he was free.

He strolled through the Milky Way, picking up a radiant star, examining it closely, then gently placing it back.

The seemingly boundless universe was, in reality, just a thought away.

So this was what true power meant—not brute force, but willpower.

Zhou Yunsheng let out a soft chuckle, tapped his wrist, and vanished into the shimmering sea of stars.

He could hardly wait to taint the Lord God's perfect world.

When he opened his eyes again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself lying on an enormous king-size bed.

Above him was a pristine white ceiling adorned with a dazzling crystal chandelier.

He propped himself up slightly and glanced at the AI device bound to his soul.

Its screen flickered on and off, displaying lines of text—detailed information stolen from the Lord God’s system regarding his new body.

As a virus that had broken free of the Lord God’s surveillance, Zhou Yunsheng naturally wouldn’t attach himself to the focal points of the world—the protagonist and heroine.

Through 007’s precise calculations, the best choice was those destined to be erased.

The so-called cannon fodder.

Altering their fate wouldn’t cause the world to collapse, but it would introduce errors into the Lord God’s calculations.

And an error in a single data point could lead to a chain reaction of cascading failures.

By the time he left, this world would already be beyond the Lord God's control.

Just like gray areas in the human brain—seemingly intact, yet irreversibly necrotic.

And when those areas accumulated over time, the entire system would eventually crash.

That was the outcome Zhou Yunsheng desired the most.


After reading through the information, he curled his lips in amusement.

This body was sixteen years old this year and was also named Zhou Yunsheng—the eldest legitimate son of the Zhou family conglomerate. He was a high school freshman and had two younger brothers in their third year of middle school, both fifteen years old. One was named Zhou Wen'ang, and the other was Zhou Wen'jing.

On the surface, Zhou Wen'ang was Zhou Yunsheng’s biological brother, sharing the same parents. In reality, however, he was swapped at birth by Father Zhou, who took advantage of Mother Zhou’s weakness after childbirth to replace their real child with the son of his beloved mistress. Zhou Yunsheng’s true younger brother, born with a congenital heart defect, had died at birth.

Zhou Wen'jing, on the other hand, was the child of a university student sponsored by Mother Zhou. The woman was an orphan with a decent character, but guilt weighed on her. Not long after giving birth, she fell into depression and eventually committed suicide by slitting her wrists. It was Mother Zhou who discovered her body. Whether it was due to shock or something else, Mother Zhou jumped into the sea the following year, and her body was never found.

The protagonist of this world was none other than the third son of the Zhou family, Zhou Wen'jing. Oppressed by the family and persecuted by his brothers since childhood, he eventually turned the tables and rose to become a business tycoon. He defeated countless opponents and fought through one thrilling corporate battle after another, ultimately reaching the pinnacle of power and wealth. Meanwhile, Zhou Yunsheng was nothing more than a stumbling block on his path—not even qualified to be a true rival.

Among the three Zhou brothers, the eldest was steady and experienced, the second was pure and straightforward, and the third was reclusive and aloof. On the surface, the eldest seemed to be the most outstanding and shrewd, yet he was, in fact, the most foolish. He treated Zhou Wen'ang as his real brother, caring for and yielding to him in all matters. Under his father’s deliberate guidance, he was led to ostracize and suppress Zhou Wen'jing, completely ignoring the obvious favoritism shown by his father. Eventually, he became nothing more than a shield, absorbing risks for Zhou Wen'ang.

In the end, he not only made an enemy of Zhou Wen'jing and suffered retaliation, but even his share of the family inheritance was schemed away by Zhou Wen'ang. Destitute and ruined, he spent the rest of his life in misery until he died in despair.

A textbook example of a cannon fodder character.

After finishing the information, Zhou Yunsheng stretched lazily and walked toward the massive floor-to-ceiling window, basking in the morning sunlight. His mind, as precise as a 007 supercomputer, was already calculating how to change the fate of the original body.

Since he was here, he would take life seriously. He wouldn't treat this world as a mere illusion or approach it with the detached attitude of playing a game.

This was a world created by the Supreme God, a vast collection of data, an alternate dimension separate from reality. However, he himself was also a string of data—or rather, a soul existing in the form of code. There was no fundamental difference between them.

The rage and heartbreak of betrayal, the agony of being killed over and over again—these pains were no less real than in the real world. In fact, because these memories were imprinted deep within his soul, they were even more profound.

He no longer wanted to be a puppet manipulated by the Supreme God. Since he had arrived, he would do everything in his power to overturn his fate and carve out his own existence.

At this moment, the sunlight was momentarily veiled by the clouds, and the smooth glass reflected the young man’s strikingly handsome yet sharp and determined face.

"Young Master Sheng, breakfast is ready. Time to get up."

Right then, the housekeeper knocked on the door.

Zhou Yunsheng withdrew his sharpness, replacing it with a warm and elegant smile. Following the original owner's habits, he changed into his school uniform and went downstairs after a quick wash.

In the dining room, Father Zhou sat at the head of the table, reading a newspaper. Zhou Wen'ang leaned on his shoulder, stretching his neck to read along. When Father Zhou was about to turn the page, Zhou Wen'ang quickly pressed the newspaper down with one hand, whining that he hadn't finished yet.

Father Zhou chuckled helplessly and pinched his son's nose affectionately.

Such warmth—had Zhou Yunsheng, the legitimate eldest son, ever received it?

Yet, under Father Zhou’s brainwashing, he had always believed that the best of everything should be given to his younger brother, that taking care of him was his responsibility.

Take care of him?

The current Zhou Yunsheng would indeed take very good care of Zhou Wen'ang. The corners of his lips curled up, making his smile appear even gentler and more sincere. He took the seat to Father Zhou’s left, casually glancing at Zhou Wen'jing, who sat with his head lowered, lost in thought.

"Young Master Sheng, a glass of milk every morning."

Father Zhou’s personal assistant, Du Xulang, walked out of the kitchen, placing a steaming cup of milk in front of him—effectively cutting off his line of sight toward Zhou Wen'jing.

Zhou Yunsheng's smile deepened, but a sharp glint flashed across his dark eyes.

He had almost forgotten—this household not only sheltered the protagonist Zhou Wen'jing but also the first male supporting lead, Du Xulang.
Without him, Zhou Wen'jing wouldn't have been able to rise to dominance ten years later, reigning supreme over the business world.

To put it more bluntly—Du Xulang was Zhou Wen'jing’s greatest god, an existence as overpowered as a game-breaking buff.




_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Chapter 1.2

Thanks to their excellent genes, the three sons of the Zhou family were all good-looking. However, as the protagonist, Zhou Wenjing naturally stood out with his appearance. His face was deep and flawless, like a masterpiece carefully sculpted by God, perfect from every angle.

In comparison, Zhou Yunsheng's features were a bit more ordinary. However, his eyes, like stars, slightly upturned at the corners, made up for this slight gap. When he looked at people directly, it didn’t seem much, but when he turned his head and glanced sideways, his gaze, sharp like a hook, could make anyone's heart race.

As the first male supporting character, Du Xulang's appearance was on par with Zhou Wenjing's. His chiseled face was strikingly handsome. But with his ear-length tousled hair and gold-rimmed glasses, he masked the dominance and sharpness in his expression with graceful gestures and a friendly smile.

On the surface, he was an overseas-educated elite with a clean family background. In reality, he was the leader of the Du family conglomerate. Due to his childhood connection with Zhou Wenjing's mother, he returned to the country to look after the son of an old friend. The Zhou family was wealthy, ranking among the top in C country, but compared to the Du family's fortune, they were insignificant. The difference between a conglomerate and a family business was vast.

In J country, organized crime was legal, and the Du family was the top gangster family with a global arms trade. A person who should have been commanding the world, yet here he was, working as a personal assistant under Zhou's father, treated like a servant, which made Zhou Yunsheng unable to understand his true thoughts.

Was it because of a childhood memory? Perhaps Zhou Wenjing’s mother was his only light in the dark world. After she died, that light never extinguished and naturally shifted to Zhou Wenjing? Was he protecting Zhou Wenjing as he would protect the last piece of his pure world?

No matter how ridiculous and absurd these guesses were, the truth was that he had already arrived. Zhou Yunsheng stopped delving further and leisurely drank his milk.

The three of them—Zhou Yunsheng, Zhou Wenjing, and Du Xulang—ate in silence, while Zhou's father and Zhou Wen'ang exchanged a few words between bites, creating a warm and harmonious atmosphere. These two were the true father and son, while the others were just extra characters. If Zhou Yunsheng had realized this sooner, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a tragic fate.

Thinking about this, Zhou Yunsheng tugged at the corner of his mouth, revealing a sarcastic smile, then glanced sideways at Du Xulang, who had just looked up.

The usually refined and handsome young man instantly turned into a figure full of arrogance and provocation, which clearly took Du Xulang by surprise. His heart skipped a beat. When he looked back again, the young man had already turned his gaze away, focusing on his porridge.

After breakfast, Du Xulang, as usual, took the three sons to school. No matter what he thought inside, he treated them all equally in front of others. However, since Zhou Wen'ang, the second son, was the most lively and cheerful, he appeared to be the closest to him.

Zhou Yunsheng immediately closed his eyes and pretended to nap as he got in the car. Zhou Wenjing remained silent, and Zhou Wen'ang, therefore, had to talk to Du Xulang, seemingly asking about Zhou's father's daily life but actually subtly probing into company matters. Du Xulang, naturally, answered every question without hesitation, showing no signs of wariness.

High school life was boring, and the mountain of homework was no challenge for a highly intelligent hacker. Zhou Yunsheng slept through the first two classes and only woke up in the third when the noise from the classroom reached his ears. Upon opening his eyes, he saw snowflakes falling outside the window.

It was almost summer, and the girls in class were already wearing skirts. How could it be snowing?

Upon closer inspection, Zhou Yunsheng realized the "snow" was actually shredded paper falling from the upper floors, creating an artificial snowstorm. It was quite a spectacle. At that moment, the class break had started, and many students crowded the hallway to watch. Zhou Yunsheng was dragged out by his close friends, who pointed at a figure standing in the snow below and said, "Cut up all his textbooks! Finally, this will give you and Wen'ang some satisfaction. A bastard child should know his place. Thinking he could compete with you and Wen'ang, he’s simply out of his mind."

Zhou Yunsheng then remembered that Zhou Wenjing and Zhou Wen'ang were both in the third year of middle school and in the same class. A few days ago, they had a disagreement over a girl, who kept defending Zhou Wenjing, making Zhou Wen'ang lose face. As the most influential figure in the school, the original Zhou Yunsheng had declared that he would teach Zhou Wenjing a lesson.

Shredded textbooks, dirt, insults, group fights—such pranks were constantly carried out against Zhou Wenjing. By the time Zhou Yunsheng had taken over, the conflict between the original Zhou Yunsheng and Zhou Wenjing had escalated to an irreconcilable point.

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his head and stared at the tall, stubborn figure, who happened to look up. Zhou Yunsheng squinted and suddenly gave a provocative smile, which made the other person clench his fists tightly, struggling to suppress his hatred.

If it were someone else, knowing their future fate, the first thing they would do would be to repair their relationship with the protagonist to try to latch onto the biggest source of power. But Zhou Yunsheng was an extremely proud person. His supreme intelligence and sharp methods made it impossible for him to ever force himself to flatter others.

Relying on the protagonist to change the original fate would still mean that his life was controlled by the protagonist, which was no different from being a puppet of the main god. Therefore, he never thought about starting with Zhou Wenjing.

Of course, he also never considered eliminating Zhou Wenjing. As the protagonist, if Zhou Wenjing died, this world would collapse, and the main god would notice the data anomaly and trace him. Although the Starry Sea Space could block the main god's search, it would still be detrimental to his future plans, making it difficult to act without concerns. One wrong move, and the main god might discover him.

With a super-intelligent entity like the main god, it surely had antivirus programs installed, and Zhou Yunsheng had no intention of testing them.

So, his current guiding principle was to change the original fate without causing a collapse of the world. As long as the protagonist remained, the world would continue, but it would no longer be the same. It would no longer be the version that the main god had calculated.

After going over all his plans in his mind, Zhou Yunsheng slowly withdrew his gaze.
Having been living life aimlessly, time always passes quickly. It feels like a whole day has gone by with just a blink of the eyes. Zhou Yunsheng, with his school uniform jacket open and a black tie loosely hanging on his white shirt, hands in his pockets, walked leisurely toward the business car parked by the roadside. His seemingly careless appearance, however, exuded an air of refined arrogance, which attracted many girls to stop and watch.

"Young Master Sheng, you’re quite popular at school. Do you have a girlfriend?" Du Xulang opened the car door for him, his smile tinged with a hint of teasing.

Before being transported to another dimension by the System, Zhou Yunsheng was a thorough-going homosexual and naturally had no interest in women. But after the villain system took over, he was forced to compete for women with the protagonist and sometimes even had to do unspeakable things to women. Heaven knows that, even if a hundred beauties stood before him stripping, he wouldn’t feel the slightest arousal.

Du Xulang's playful words momentarily reminded him of the nauseating feeling of being violated, and his usually gentle smile faded, replaced by a cold, sharp gaze that pierced through Du Xulang’s eyes.

Du Xulang had never taken the Zhou brothers, Zhou Yunsheng and Zhou Wenang, seriously. Especially Zhou Yunsheng, who was nothing but a complete fool, manipulated by Zhou Wenang without even realizing it. But that sharp look he just showed instantly shattered Du Xulang's impression of him.

This was not the look of a young man who was all show and easily trusting.

However, before Du Xulang could think any further, Zhou Yunsheng lowered his eyes and spoke indifferently, "Let's go, no need to wait. Wenang’s last class is P.E., and he finished early, 20 minutes ahead of schedule."

Du Xulang nodded, started the car, and drove off. They passed through a dark alley, and Zhou Yunsheng suddenly spoke up, "Pull over here, I need to do something."

The car slowed and parked by the roadside, but Zhou Yunsheng didn’t get out. Instead, he rolled down the window, resting his chin on his hand, smiling as he looked into the alley.

On both sides of the alley, towering skyscrapers blocked the light, making the place quite dark. A few large trash bins emitted a foul odor, attracting many stray cats and dogs. Suddenly, there was a dull thud, and a dark figure crashed into a trash bin, then awkwardly fell to the ground. A wild cat hiding inside the bin let out a scream and quickly ran off.

Du Xulang's expression subtly changed when he saw the face of the person, and he immediately moved to get out of the car to help. But Zhou Yunsheng held him back with a firm grip on his shoulder.

"He won’t die," Zhou Yunsheng said lazily, applying subtle pressure on Du Xulang's shoulder.

Du Xulang reluctantly withdrew his hand from the door handle and forced a smile.

Zhou Wenjing seemed to want to fight back. Before he could even get up, a tall man stepped on his back and stamped on him a few times. Several young men with colorful hair gathered around, ransacked his belongings, kicked him, and left after threatening him, laughing as they walked away.

Scenes like this were common in the bustling, noisy city and hardly evoked any sympathy from passersby. Zhou Yunsheng, the one who initiated this, smiled with satisfaction.

Yes, these people were hired by the original Zhou Yunsheng to give Zhou Wenjing a lesson—neither too big nor too small. With the memories of the original host now in his mind, Zhou Yunsheng was determined to go ahead with this plan. Not only was he here to watch the show, but he also brought the protagonist’s bodyguard along.

Du Xulang adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, concealing the frost building up in his eyes. The eldest son of the Zhou family sure loved to court death.

Zhou Wenjing struggled to get up, nearly falling again when he bent down to pick up his bag. Du Xulang secretly gripped the steering wheel tighter. After several attempts, he finally managed to grab his bag. He stood up, spat out a bloody phlegm into the trash bin, and walked out expressionlessly. As soon as he saw Zhou Yunsheng’s gentle smile in the car, his face instantly contorted with fury.

"It’s you!" His voice was full of hatred, the words squeezed through gritted teeth.

"Yes, it’s me," Zhou Yunsheng nodded nonchalantly.

Zhou Wenjing could no longer hold back and charged toward Zhou Yunsheng, ready to throw a punch. But the car door suddenly swung open, slamming into him, and he collapsed onto the ground, unable to get up for a while.

Zhou Yunsheng walked slowly over to him, slightly bent down, and gave him a mockingly appraising look, as if surveying a clown. Du Xulang followed closely behind, 
ready to intervene in case Zhou Yunsheng decided to take further action.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Chapter 1.3

Zhou Wenjing felt like he could tear Zhou Yunsheng apart with his bare hands. Just as he was about to get up, Zhou Yunsheng kicked him far away, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The original host had been schemed against by Zhou Wen'ang, losing his position as the heir of the Zhou family and all his wealth, his life falling into a deep abyss. At the time, the protagonist, already a business tycoon, added insult to injury, making it impossible for the original host to find a decent job for the rest of his life, eventually succumbing to depression and ending his life.

After taking over the original host's body and learning of his fate, Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t even consider trying to get close to the protagonist. He felt that if he didn’t kill him immediately, it was already a sign of self-control. If it weren’t for Du Xulang forcibly holding him back, he would have gone over to kick him a few more times.

“Sheng Shao, don’t bully the poor youth,” the handsome young man adjusted his glasses, sounding half-serious, half-warning.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t care and brushed off the hand on his shoulder. He slowly walked over to Zhou Wenjing. Zhou Wenjing, unable to get up, could only stare at him with hateful eyes.

“You hate me?” Zhou Yunsheng tilted his head.

In response, Zhou Wenjing spat out a mouthful of blood-tainted saliva.

Zhou Yunsheng sidestepped, stepped on Zhou Wenjing's chest with one foot, and coldly sneered, "You hate me? What right do you have to hate me? Without my mother's help, your mom, an orphan, wouldn't have been able to attend the best university in the country. Why could she start working at Zhou's right after graduation, earning hundreds of thousands a year? My mother treated her like a daughter, but how did she repay her? She slept with her adoptive father? Had children with him? It's fine that she died, but why did she have to die in my mother's bathtub? Was she atoning, or was she using her life to get back at my mother? Well, she got what she wanted. My mother followed in her footsteps, leaving me all alone. You tell me, who should I hate?”

The more he spoke, the redder Zhou Yunsheng's eyes became, forcing him to stop and take a deep breath. His hoarse voice was filled with intense anger and hatred, as if he wanted to destroy everything in front of him.

Zhou Wenjing was shocked by the sudden outburst and didn’t dare to meet his gaze. Du Xulang, who had been about to pull Zhou Yunsheng away, felt a slight tremor in his heart.

Before coming, he had investigated Zhou Wenjing's situation in the Zhou family and felt pity for him. However, he hadn’t looked at it from Zhou Yunsheng's perspective. After hearing Zhou Yunsheng’s accusations, he suddenly realized that the biggest victim was actually Zhou Yunsheng's mother. The pain and hatred of this abandoned child were no less than those of Zhou Wenjing.

The illegitimate child might be pitied, but what about the legitimate child? As another illegitimate child, Du Xulang had never considered this before.

The air hung heavy for a moment before Zhou Yunsheng slowly regained his composure and asked, “Tell me, if you were me, what would you feel?”

What would he feel? Of course, it would be hatred—immense hatred. Zhou Wenjing secretly clenched his fists, confusion in his eyes.

Zhou Yunsheng suddenly found the whole situation boring. He moved his foot from Zhou Wenjing’s chest, coldly laughed, and said, “The one you should hate most is not me, but Zhou Hao (Zhou's father). He’s the one who killed your mother.” He waved at Du Xulang. “Let’s go.”

“What about Wenjing? Should we send him to the hospital?” Du Xulang asked, his concern evident. He had always presented himself as a nice guy and wasn’t worried that Zhou Yunsheng would become suspicious.

“He’s tough; he won’t die,” Zhou Yunsheng said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. His piercing gaze made Du Xulang feel slightly breathless.

The car slowly drove away, leaving Zhou Wenjing standing in confusion and loneliness. He still hated Zhou Yunsheng, but his hatred for Zhou Hao had grown stronger than ever. In that moment, he silently swore that one day, he would destroy Zhou Hao and the Zhou family. As for Zhou Yunsheng, it was enough to make him lose everything he had once been proud of.

Du Xulang seemed to be focused on the road, but in reality, he was discreetly studying Zhou Yunsheng out of the corner of his eye. At that moment, he felt mixed emotions towards the young man—he found him hateful, but also pitiful, with a bit of inexplicable curiosity.

“Sheng Shao, although Wenjing’s mother…” He paused ever so slightly before continuing, “...apologized to your mother, but Wenjing didn’t do anything wrong. You’re constantly targeting him. Isn’t that a bit too much? As the saying goes, leave a line in life for future encounters. After all, he’s your brother. Don’t push things to an irreversible point.”

If it were any other time, he wouldn’t have spoken such blunt words to Zhou Yunsheng. Despite Zhou Yunsheng being the rightful heir to the Zhou family and the most qualified to inherit Zhou’s group, Zhou Hao might not necessarily think so. Zhou Yunsheng was oblivious to this, but as an outsider, Du Xulang could see it clearly. Zhou Hao’s attitude toward Zhou Wen'ang was completely different from how he treated the other two brothers—he was almost doting to the point of being shameless. If Zhou Wen'ang ever intended to take over Zhou's, Zhou Hao would never oppose it.

As for Zhou Wenjing, he probably already viewed the Zhou family as his own property. It was a pity that Zhou Yunsheng still considered him a good brother, completely unguarded, and being used to the fullest. If Zhou Wen'ang rose to power, with his cold-hearted nature, even though they were brothers by blood, Zhou Yunsheng’s life would likely be difficult, and he would never know when he would be betrayed.

With that thought, Du Xulang’s gaze toward Zhou Yunsheng carried a subtle trace of sympathy. Looking at it this way, Zhou Yunsheng seemed to be the most pitiful of the Zhou brothers. Zhou Wenjing had his protector, Zhou Wen'ang had Zhou Hao, but Zhou Yunsheng was all alone, in a precarious situation.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t know what Du Xulang was thinking, nor would he care if he did. He chuckled before waving his hand, saying, “I never planned to inherit the Zhou family. Why should I care if he hates me?”

Du Xulang’s eyes flickered, and he asked, “Not planning to inherit the Zhou family? What do you mean, Sheng Shao?”

“Just what it says,” Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him sideways, then turned his gaze to the window and stopped speaking.

Zhou Wenjing didn't return to the Zhou family until after 9 PM. As soon as he opened the door, he saw Du Xulang standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, smoking a cigarette. His scattered bangs were neatly combed back, revealing his handsome and sharp facial features. He extinguished the cigarette and turned to look at Zhou Wenjing, whose strong, natural aura made Zhou Wenjing feel both afraid and, more so, a sense of admiration.

"Uncle, I'm back," he immediately closed the door behind him and lowered his voice. He didn't know Du Xulang's true identity—he only knew that the man was a friend of his mother’s from the orphanage, as close as siblings, and had returned specifically to take care of him. However, due to his powerful presence and extraordinary capabilities, Zhou Wenjing was aware that Du Xulang was no ordinary person.

"How are your injuries?" Du Xulang asked, extinguishing his cigarette.

"As soon as I received your message, Dr. Fang came. My hand is fractured, the rest are just some superficial wounds." Zhou Wenjing shook his left hand, which was in a cast, gritting his teeth as he said, "One day, I'll trample the Zhou family underfoot, and make Zhou Yuncheng pay for everything that happened today!"

Du Xulang didn't think much of his plan to deal with the Zhou family, but at the last sentence, he furrowed his brows, though he didn't say anything.

Meanwhile, Zhou Wenang knocked on Zhou Yuncheng's door.

"Elder brother, did you have someone hurt that bastard? You truly are my real elder brother," Zhou Wenang affectionately draped his arm over Zhou Yuncheng’s shoulder.

"Yes, I had someone do it." Zhou Yuncheng subtly pulled away, walking over to the desk to fiddle with his computer. A series of codes rapidly appeared and disappeared on the dark screen, lighting up his face intermittently.

"Elder brother, that bastard is truly a nuisance. You should think of a way to send him abroad, preferably never to return."

The ideas for tormenting Zhou Wenjing always came from Zhou Wenang, and Zhou Yuncheng would carry them out. All the hatred was directed at Zhou Yuncheng, while Zhou Wenang played the good guy behind the scenes, offering Zhou Wenjing small favors. As a result, although Zhou Wenjing’s relationship with Zhou Wenang wasn’t close, it wasn’t bad either. Even if Zhou Wenjing were to take over the Zhou family, Zhou Wenang would still be a member of the board, living a comfortable life.

This kind of situation had happened before. Not only did Zhou Wenang urge Zhou Yuncheng to send Zhou Wenjing abroad, but he also bribed several drug dealers to get Zhou Wenjing hooked on drugs. If Du Xulang hadn't arrived in time and forced him to quit, Zhou Wenjing’s life would have been ruined.

All the retribution was taken by Zhou Yuncheng, while the real villain, Zhou Wenang, rode on the coattails of the protagonist, living a smooth life. What kind of world was this?

Zhou Yuncheng sneered inwardly and, staring at the computer screen, said淡ly, "You figure it out yourself. I've been busy recently."

"What are you busy with?" This was the first time his elder brother had refused him, and Zhou Wenang couldn't help but frown.

"I'm applying to study abroad. I've already selected the school, and the application is in progress. Dad doesn’t know yet. Once the application is approved, I'll talk to him. You must keep it a secret for me." Zhou Yuncheng pressed the Enter key, and the computer screen showed a student application form for Hockisky High School in Connecticut, USA, stamped with an initial approval, waiting for final approval in a week.

Hockisky High School was one of the best secondary schools in the U.S., with strict admission requirements and was often referred to as the "Little Ivy League." Every year, countless people applied, but only a few made it through the approval process.

A flash of jealousy appeared in Zhou Wenang’s eyes but quickly subsided. Compared to getting rid of Zhou Wenjing, what he truly wanted was to get rid of Zhou Yuncheng. Now, Zhou Yuncheng had chosen to leave on his own, which saved him a lot of effort. When Zhou Yuncheng returned, it was uncertain who would be in charge of the Zhou family.

Moreover, the security in the U.S. was poor, and every year, a few international students went missing for no apparent reason. He wondered if Zhou Yuncheng would be one of those unlucky souls.

Chapter 1.4

Although Zhou Wen'ang was eager for Zhou Yunsheng to leave the country immediately, he patiently said many words of persuasion until he was sure of the other's determination, then reluctantly agreed.

After Zhou Wen'ang left, Zhou Yunsheng pulled up a document on his computer and smirked coldly. It was a will amendment, signed by Yang Xi, the original host's mother. As a hacker, searching for information online was always Zhou Yunsheng's habit. Although he knew the general direction of this world's development, he wouldn't overlook any hidden details.

This amendment was found in Yang Xi's email, which transferred all the inheritance originally meant for Zhou Wen'ang to the eldest son. In other words, she didn't intend to leave a single penny for her younger son.

Yang Xi, influenced by Zhou's father, had always favored her younger son. Under normal circumstances, she would never have treated him this way. Moreover, this amended will was drafted a week before her death, but it was deleted before it could be sent to the lawyer, and she committed suicide by jumping into the sea shortly after.

How could such a coincidence exist? Who deleted the will? Was her death truly a suicide? After her death, the lawyer still received an amended will, which stated that all her property would go to the younger son, while the eldest son only received three villas and some jewelry.

The original host didn't mind this unfair distribution of inheritance, even finding it natural. However, Yang Xi's parents felt uneasy and personally came to inquire. At that time, Zhou's father explained that the eldest son would inherit the Zhou family business, while the younger son was less capable and needed the inheritance to support himself.

Yang Xi's parents, who dearly loved their grandson, quickly accepted this explanation. From then on, under Zhou's father's deliberate guidance, Zhou Yunsheng distanced himself from his maternal grandparents, while Zhou Wen'ang frequently visited them, gaining many benefits from the Yang family.

The original host was so foolish that it's no wonder he died so miserably. Zhou Yunsheng shook his head and locked the will in his computer. Sooner or later, he would reclaim everything that belonged to the original host.

After learning that Zhou Yunsheng planned to go abroad, Zhou Wen'ang accelerated his efforts to force Zhou Wenjing out. With these two obstacles removed, the Zhou Group would fall into his hands.

One day, Zhou Wenjing was expelled from school for allegedly stealing a classmate's luxury watch worth hundreds of thousands. The victim's parents, who were influential figures, personally visited the Zhou family to speak with Zhou's father. Feeling deeply humiliated, Zhou's father beat Zhou Wenjing with a belt after the guests left and decided to send him abroad.

"I didn't steal anything! Zhou Yunsheng framed me! Uncle, you have to believe me!" Zhou Wenjing lay on the bed, his back covered in wounds, clutching Du Xulang's sleeve tightly with one hand.

"I know you didn't do it. I believe you," Du Xulang patted his head soothingly. After Zhou Wenjing fell asleep with tears in his eyes, Du Xulang quietly went to the boy's room, raising his hand but unsure why he had come. He believed Zhou Wenjing was innocent, but he also knew that Zhou Yunsheng wasn't behind this.

Zhou Yunsheng enjoyed tormenting Zhou Wenjing, whether through beatings or threats, always doing so openly without fear of being discovered. Framing someone and ruining their future wasn't his style. The one who would do such a thing was the deceitful Zhou Wen'ang.

Although Du Xulang understood this, he didn't plan to explain it to Zhou Wenjing. Protecting him didn't mean shielding him from all hardships. He wanted Zhou Wenjing to experience the storms of life and grow into a strong individual. The world was full of hypocrites like Zhou Wen'ang, and Zhou Wenjing needed to learn to recognize them.

As Du Xulang was about to leave quietly, the door opened, and the boy stood there, arms crossed, leaning against the doorframe.

"What? Here to seek justice for Zhou Wenjing?"

Du Xulang shook his head, but before he could explain, the boy stepped aside, gesturing for him to come in. He had no choice but to follow.

"Take a seat," Zhou Yunsheng pointed to a single armchair beside a floor lamp, its warm orange glow creating a cozy atmosphere.

"Do you mind if I smoke?" Du Xulang crossed his long legs and took out a cigarette from his suit pocket, lighting it. Accustomed to being in power, he rarely cared about others' opinions, but he asked out of politeness. The boy's room was so warm and comfortable that he couldn't help but relax.

"I do mind," Zhou Yunsheng walked over, took the cigarette from his mouth, and threw it into a steaming cup of milk. The sizzling sound seemed to mock someone.

Du Xulang was stunned. Since he took over the Du family conglomerate at twenty, no one had dared to treat him like this. He found it amusing and chuckled softly.

Zhou Yunsheng ignored him, sitting down at his desk and fiddling with his computer. Without looking up, he said, "Zhou Wenjing's expulsion wasn't my doing."

"I know it wasn't you. I didn't come here to accuse you," Du Xulang stopped laughing and explained gently. He just wanted to talk to the boy. Ever since the boy revealed his vulnerability in the dark alley that day, Du Xulang had felt a sense of pity for him and couldn't help but pay more attention.

Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him in surprise, then said after a moment of silence, "Then you should know who's behind this. Let me tell you, I'm also planning to go abroad, leaving the day after tomorrow."

"Where to?" The man, who had been lounging casually, suddenly straightened his back.

"To Country A, like Zhou Wenjing. But I'll be attending Hodgkins Academy," Zhou Yunsheng spun his chair around to face the man, adding meaningfully, "You know how bad the security is in Country A, with rampant drug problems. You'd better keep a close eye on Zhou Wenjing, lest someone lead him astray."

Du Xulang's heart stirred, but his expression remained unchanged. He smiled and asked, "Once he's abroad, Zhou Wenjing will have to fend for himself. What does that have to do with me? Why should I keep an eye on him?"

Zhou Yunsheng didn't answer. Instead, he pressed the enter key, and a black-and-white photo slowly appeared on the computer screen. It showed a teenage girl sitting on the grass, holding a four or five-year-old boy in her arms. Both were smiling brightly in the dappled sunlight. The girl was unmistakably Zhou Wenjing's deceased mother, and the boy's features bore a striking resemblance to Du Xulang.

The photo instantly brought back long-buried memories for Du Xulang, memories of the only warmth and happiness he had ever experienced. But all of that had ended with the death of his loved one.

"Before you were adopted by the Smiths, you stayed at Yupei Orphanage, where you were as close as siblings with Zhou Wenjing's mother. They say an elder sister is like a mother, so your feelings for her must have been deep. How could you abandon her son?"

Although Zhou Yunsheng knew everything, he didn't plan to reveal all the truths, such as Du Xulang's real identity. His fabricated identity was that of a child adopted by an A-country couple from C-country, which also made it easier for him to recognize Zhou Wenjing.

The reason Zhou Yunsheng told Du Xulang so much today was to clarify his neutral stance. Du Xulang had immense influence, and if he decided to make things difficult, Zhou Yunsheng would find himself in a tough spot.

As for the protagonist, he was still weak now. By the time he grew stronger, Zhou Yunsheng believed he would also have become powerful enough to be unshakable. Having lived through hundreds or even thousands of lifetimes, his greatest asset was stored in his brilliant mind. The technology in this world wasn't backward, but it wasn't advanced either, far from the world he originally came from, let alone the interstellar era he had experienced in his reincarnations.

By writing a few programs and developing some software, he could amass a vast fortune in a short time. He possessed wisdom, so no matter how dire the situation, he could remain calm. But if he could avoid trouble and obstacles, that would be even better.

Du Xulang stared at the photo for a long time before sighing and finally taking the young man before him seriously. To uncover even a hint of the truth despite his efforts to conceal it, this young man was anything but ordinary.

Zhou Yunsheng gave him a sarcastic smile. "Do you remember? Every holiday, you and your sister would receive new clothes and toys from a certain Ms. Yang. That Ms. Yang was my mother, Yang Xi." He had played the villain long enough and decided that in every subsequent life, he would stand on the moral high ground. Although Yang Xi might not have been driven to death by Zhou Wenjing's mother but rather murdered by Zhou Hao, why should he tell this man? Making him feel guilty and thus more accommodating better served his ultimate interests.

Du Xulang was completely stunned. It took him a long while to finally say in a hoarse voice, "I'm sorry, I forgot." He was only five at the time and was soon taken back by the Du family, so he didn't have a deep impression of Ms. Yang, who had never shown her face.

After he left, Ms. Yang continued to support his sister, allowing her to escape the harsh environment of the orphanage, attend the best university in C-country, and secure a job at the Zhou Corporation.

This was a life-changing kindness, but how did his sister repay it? She destroyed her benefactor's family and indirectly caused her death. Even worse, he himself had never cared for the benefactor's child and had even considered eliminating him to pave the way for Zhou Wenjing, all because Zhou Wenjing had told him that his sister had been driven to death by Yang Xi.

What a complete inversion of right and wrong, repaying kindness with enmity. Du Xulang wiped his face, not daring to think further.

"No need to apologize. She didn't care for your gratitude. There are plenty of ungrateful people in the world; who hasn't encountered a few?" Zhou Yunsheng stood up, opened the door, and said, "It's late. You should go. Don't forget to take the milk with you."

Du Xulang smiled bitterly, picked up the cup of milk with the cigarette butt floating in it, and left with heavy steps. He tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep.

The two Zhou brothers went abroad one after the other, one attending the prestigious Hodgkins Academy, a small Ivy League school, and the other attending the elite Repton School. Not long after, Du Xulang, Zhou's father's personal assistant, resigned and disappeared without a trace.

A year and a half later, a storm swept through the IT world. A tech company called Noah Universe developed a Star Wars online game that became a global sensation within a month of its beta release. Its exclusive sensory helmet provided players with an immersive experience, ushering in a new era of online gaming.

With this game and the sensory helmet, Noah Universe quickly amassed a huge fortune and went public on NASDAQ the following year, becoming a dark horse in the IT industry with immense potential.

The technology contained in the sensory helmet was so advanced that no one could decipher it. Countless IT giants wanted to poach the computer genius behind Noah Universe but couldn't even find out who it was.

Chapter 1.5

In the dimly lit room, a thin young man was bound to a four-poster bed, his body covered in sticky sweat. His eye sockets were deeply sunken, and his skin had taken on the pale, sickly hue typical of drug addicts. He had just endured a withdrawal reaction and was now staring blankly at the canopy above, lost in thought.

The sound of steady footsteps grew closer. A tall man in an iron-gray suit, his figure strikingly large, opened the door and walked over to the bed to check on him. His black hair was slicked back, revealing an exceptionally handsome face. His narrow eyes occasionally flashed with a dangerous gleam, making him appear intimidating.

"I’ll have the nurse give you a bath," he said, pulling a handkerchief from his coat pocket to wipe the cold sweat from the young man's forehead.

The young man licked his cracked lips and, with a hoarse voice, said, "Uncle, it was Zhou Yunsheng who framed me. I remember now. I saw that woman before, she was drinking with Zhou Yunsheng at Whiskey. They looked very close. He must have instructed her to harm me!"

The young man was Zhou Wenjing, currently a second-year university student. A few months ago, he had gotten involved with a beautiful woman, only to find out that she had ulterior motives. She had given him a drug-laced cigarette that contained a potent substance, enough to cause addiction with just one hit. Zhou Wenjing, though naturally suspicious and cautious about his safety, had a fatal weakness—his attraction to beautiful women. He never turned down any woman who was attractive.

It wasn't until he first experienced the drug withdrawal that he realized something was wrong, but by then, it was too late, and he had to call his uncle, who was far away in Country J.

Du Xulang threw the half-wet handkerchief into the trash, his anger simmering. The anger was not because he believed his nephew's accusation, but because of the disappointment in him. He had warned him countless times not to accept anything offered by strangers and had even sent a few bodyguards to follow him secretly.

But bodyguards were not full-time nannies; they couldn't control the employer's personal matters. Zhou Wenjing wanted to chase women, and they couldn't stop him.

This was pure self-destructive behavior!

Suppressing his anger, Du Xulang washed his hands, then picked up the landline to notify the nurse to come upstairs and bathe his nephew. Only then did he sit on the couch and say, "This wasn’t Yunsheng’s doing. Think about who else you’ve offended."

He had already found out who was behind it, but he wasn’t planning to tell his nephew. If he couldn't even identify his true enemies, he would eventually be taken down without a trace. Du Xulang would guide him and help him when necessary, but he would not personally eliminate his enemies. If it weren't for Du Xulang telling him that his sister had been forced to death by Yang Xi, he would never have thought of killing Zhou Yunsheng.

Hatred is highly contagious. His nephew hated Yang Xi and his son to the bone, so Du Xulang had turned a blind eye and helped him with his revenge. If it hadn’t been for Zhou Yunsheng’s words that had awakened him, Du Xulang would have almost repaid kindness with ingratitude. Since then, the trust he had in his nephew’s words had dropped significantly.

"It wasn't him, who else could it be? Who benefits from hurting me?" Zhou Wenjing's gaunt face was filled with resentment and unwillingness. He had already noticed that his uncle’s feelings for Zhou Yunsheng were growing stronger and that he seemed to have an inexplicable interest in him. Once, he had even found many photos of Zhou Yunsheng in his uncle’s nightstand. Judging by the angles, each one was a candid shot, beautifully composed, capturing the essence of his features.

Although Zhou Yunsheng wasn’t as handsome as he was, his delicate features had a strange allure, especially those eyes, as clear and tranquil as the moon reflected in water. When they narrowed and looked straight into the camera, it was almost as if they could pull someone’s heart right out of their chest.

The photo at the top of the pile was slightly worn at the corners, showing how much the collector cherished it. If Zhou Wenjing wasn’t so cautious, he believed his uncle would have framed the photo and covered an entire wall with them.

He couldn’t understand where this fascination came from. Was it because his mother had sent a few clothes and toys to his uncle when he was young? His uncle had left the orphanage at five, how much gratitude could she have given him? Even if she had supported his mother, who had repaid her with her life, was that not enough?

Yes, Zhou Wenjing had realized—his mother hadn't been driven to death by Zhou Yunsheng’s mother. Instead, it was his own mother who had caused Zhou Yunsheng’s mother’s death. At first, he thought his mother had committed suicide in Yang Xi’s bathtub as revenge, until one day when Zhou Yunsheng had yelled at him in an alley, he realized that his mother, being so kind-hearted, must have felt guilty toward Yang Xi. She had killed herself in Yang Xi's bathtub to show her: "I’ve repaid everything I owed you."

But her thinking was too simple and blind. She never expected her death would indirectly lead to Yang Xi's death, causing their children to walk down the path of hatred, with no way to resolve it. Even if he were willing to spare Zhou Yunsheng, Zhou Yunsheng would never spare him.

Du Xulang frowned, dissatisfied with his nephew's narrow-mindedness and obstinacy, and said coldly, "You can suspect anyone, but not Yunsheng. Think carefully, who else stands to gain?"

Yunsheng? When did his tone become so intimate? Zhou Wenjing’s face revealed a flash of jealousy. Seeing his uncle’s sharp and cold gaze, he started to think seriously and then thought of Zhou Wen’ang.

No, it couldn’t be Wen’ang. He had been the only one to show him kindness when he first arrived at the Zhou family. He would secretly send him medicine for his injuries, celebrate his birthday in secret, and even accompany him to visit his mother’s grave. How could it be him? His father had always said that since he inherited Yang Xi's estate, there was no place for him in the Zhou family business.

He had no conflict of interest with Zhou Wen’ang. Why would he harm him?

Zhou Wenjing shook his head, rejecting the idea. After thinking for a long time, he still felt that Zhou Yunsheng was the one pulling the strings.

Du Xulang saw that his nephew still couldn’t figure it out and was too lazy to say more. As soon as the nurse arrived, he returned to his study and clicked on the video call.

"What’s the matter?" A handsome face appeared on the screen, his expression lazy. The dark circles under his eyes were slightly red from staying up late.

"Still coding? It’s already 2:30 AM, you should sleep," Du Xulang said, glancing at his watch. His tone, though seemingly neutral, held a hint of concern.

"About to sleep." Zhou Yunsheng tilted his head back and dropped a few drops of eye drops to relieve dryness.

The young man wiped away the tears at the corners of his eyes. His slightly squinted eyes shimmered, captivating and mesmerizing, causing Du Xulang to gasp. He leaned back in his chair, crossed his long legs, and waited until his breathing and heartbeat were steady before speaking in a hoarse voice, "Wen Jing is currently in detox. Do you know Elsa?"

Elsa was the woman who had lured Zhou Wenjing into drug use. Zhou Yunsheng immediately smiled, "One day, he'll die because of a woman." He picked up the steaming milk on the table and drank it in one go, licking his lips as he continued, "I know her. A few months ago, she gave me a cigarette laced with drugs. You know, my nose is very sensitive, so I turned it down."

With 007 in hand, Zhou Yunsheng could adjust his body data at will, such as enhancing his senses, strength, and mental power. But he adjusted according to the world's tolerance, making sure to exceed ordinary people's capabilities without becoming overwhelmingly strong, as that would cause the collapse of the world.

Before Elsa could even hand him the cigarette, he had already smelled the pungent odor of the drugs.

Du Xulang had just relaxed when he heard Zhou Yunsheng say, "Haven't you been keeping people around to monitor me? The truth should be clear. I won't harm your nephew, you can rest assured."

"I would never monitor you. My hands aren’t that long." Du Xulang’s pupils shrank slightly, but his face remained unchanged. He was still using a false identity, and even Zhou Wenjing didn’t know that his uncle was the head of the Du family conglomerate. Zhou Wenjing only thought that after resigning, Du Xulang had gone to Country J and was now a middle manager in a company, with a little money but no power.

"There’s nowhere your Du Xulang can’t reach in this world. Look at this." Zhou Yunsheng pulled out a photo from his drawer and brought it close to the camera.

This was the only photo of the head of the Du family captured by the media. Due to being surrounded by heavy bodyguards, the shot was taken from far away, only showing a side profile, and it was very blurry. Not even Du Xulang himself would recognize it, so after its release, the Du family had not suppressed it.

"Who would have thought that this Du Xulang (the fake name previously made up) is the same Du Xulang from Country J? Just one letter off, and the truth is so close, yet no one doubts it. Head of the Du family, have you had enough of playing these games?" Zhou Yunsheng put the photo down and raised his eyebrows slightly.

Du Xulang struggled weakly, "The photo is so blurry, how can you be sure it’s me?"

"I forgot to tell you, our company just developed an identification software. Not only can it identify someone from a side profile, but even just a photo of their back of the head. Based on factors like bone structure, height, weight, and gait, it can determine the person’s true identity. Currently, the defense department of Country A is planning to buy this software at a high price to track terrorists. Would you like me to demonstrate it to you now?" Zhou Yunsheng picked up a scanner, preparing to scan the photo into the computer and compare it to Du Xulang’s real face.

He knew that Du Xulang, with his vast network, would surely know about his connection with Noah Global, so he never hid it from him.

"No need, I am Du Xulang." Du Xulang smiled wryly, then asked, "When did you find out?" He felt strangely happy realizing that his identity had been exposed, yet Zhou Yunsheng was still so calm about it.

"Almost two years ago. If you want to play, I’ll play along. Are you satisfied?" Zhou Yunsheng reached for the button to turn off the video.

"Don’t turn off the video, I still have something to say." Du Xulang leaned forward unconsciously and stared seriously at the camera, "I’m not monitoring you, nor do I suspect you, I’m protecting you. Do you know how many troubles I’ve helped you avoid over the years? Just the other day, the bodyguard who was following you caught a street thug who was planning to rob you. He had a gun, and the bullet was already chambered. Do you know what that means?"

Zhou Yunsheng withdrew his hand and sneered, "Someone wants to kill me, who is it?"

"You don’t know?" Du Xulang took out a cigarette and lit it, the white smoke blurring the coldness in his eyes.

Zhou Yunsheng’s company had been growing bigger, and he must have offended some people, but the one truly wanting to kill him was, after thinking about it, Zhou Wenang. After a brief pause, he understood.

Du Xulang exhaled a puff of smoke, softened his tone, and persuaded, "You should go back. Once you’re back in the country, he can’t openly deal with you. With your grandparents and uncles watching, at least it’s much safer than abroad. If you wait a few more years, Zhou family might not have a place for you anymore. It’s your family’s business, no one has the right to compete with you."

"Not even Zhou Wenjing?" Zhou Yunsheng instinctively asked.

"Not even Zhou Wenjing." Du Xulang nodded firmly. Perhaps out of a sense of compensation, or sympathy, Du Xulang originally thought Zhou Wenjing would share the Zhou family inheritance, but he had changed his mind. He could help Wenjing start his own business, but the Zhou family had to be Yunsheng’s. He was the rightful heir of the Zhou family conglomerate.

Moreover, Du Xulang felt that the relationship between the Zhou brothers was strange. The Zhou family was just an ordinary business family, not a family like the Du family with a deep historical background. There was no need for violent struggles for inheritance. If Zhou Wenang won, he could just kick his brother out of the family, so why escalate it to such an extreme level? He should have hated Wenjing, but instead, he was even more vicious toward his own brother. It didn’t make sense.

Du Xulang had investigated the past of the two brothers. From childhood to adulthood, Zhou Yunsheng had been caring and attentive to Zhou Wenang, with no signs of animosity. He couldn’t understand why Zhou Wenang would hate Zhou Yunsheng to the point of wanting to kill him.

Thinking deeply, he couldn’t help but ask.

Why? Because Zhou Wenang’s position was not legitimate. If Zhou Yunsheng ever discovered the truth, he would lose everything he had. Even if Zhou Yunsheng didn’t take action against him, Yang Xi’s parents would make sure he would meet a horrible end. The Yang family’s influence was complex, and they controlled a wide range of industries, including underworld businesses. Yang Xi’s parents and siblings were all ruthless characters, fiercely protective of her. They were extremely fond of Zhou Wenang now, but once they knew the truth, they would hate him with equal intensity.

Zhou Yunsheng was the sword hanging over Zhou Wenang’s head, the thorn in his heart. Only by getting rid of him could Zhou Wenang finally relax. Zhou Wenang’s father likely had the same mindset, which was why he had encouraged his eldest son to distance himself from the Yang family.

At this moment, Zhou Yunsheng thought a lot, but he didn’t intend to tell Du Xulang any of it. He sneered as he took off his clothes, saying, "Why do you care so much? I’ll handle my own business. If Zhou Wenang likes the Zhou family, let him have it. I don’t care. My Noah Global will one day crush the Zhou family."

Throwing his clothes aside and running his fingers through his hair, he walked straight into the bathroom to shower, forgetting to turn off the camera.

The once young boy had now grown into a handsome and charming young man. Having stayed indoors for so long without sunlight, his skin was pale to the point of being almost translucent, but the tight muscles in his abdomen and the graceful shape of his body showed that he had been training well. He stood up and undid his belt, revealing his toned waist. Due to his perky hips, his pants didn’t slide down further but hung loosely on his hips.

His lazy and casual posture was extremely sensual.

Du Xulang watched intently. When the young man walked out of the frame, he even craned his neck, trying to follow him.

Zhou Yunsheng quickly took a shower, his towel wrapped around his waist as he walked out. His long, straight legs once again drew Du Xulang’s gaze. He seemed oblivious to the strange expression and stiff posture of the man, casually wishing him goodnight before turning off the video.

The sultry scene disappeared, and Du Xulang slowly exhaled a sigh, holding his forehead and laughing bitterly. It seemed he had been lured in, but tragically, the other person had no such intention.

Did Zhou Yunsheng really not have any such intention? As soon as he turned off the camera, he smiled with a slight curve at the corners of his lips. He was gay, and his standards were high. Du Xulang was a bisexual, with a perfect appearance and physique. Why would Zhou Yunsheng settle for something less when he could have perfection?

As for what would happen afterward, he hadn’t thought about it yet. Having been a puppet to the system for so long, he just wanted to live according to his own desires.


————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Chapter 1.6

Zhou Yunsheng thought that when two men hit it off, they would directly move to the next stage—hooking up. But Du Xulang’s intentions clearly went beyond his expectations.

It seemed that Du Xulang was pursuing him, from making one call every few days to calling three to five times a day, and whenever he came to A country, he would insist on inviting him out for a meal. But it was always just a simple meal, with Du Xulang maintaining a polite yet not overly forward attitude throughout. During holidays, he would also send expensive gifts.

Zhou Yunsheng had no choice but to shamelessly believe—Du Xulang was pursuing him, and his attitude was serious. This feeling was undoubtedly new for someone who had always met a tragic death and been hated by the male and female leads in every life. He never had a happy ending, never met a true love, and was always betrayed. Zhou Yunsheng thought he had become numb to “love.”

But after breaking free from the system's constraints, he realized that he had just deeply buried his own desires. Since Du Xulang was sincere, he decided to go with the flow. As for whether they would last, that was another issue.

While contemplating, the phone on the table rang, and sure enough, the deep, magnetic voice of the man came through, “Do you still like the watch I gave you? I bought the same model, it matches well…”

J Country, Kyoto

Du Xulang stood at the top of a skyscraper, gently talking on the phone while leisurely smoking. He didn’t know what the person on the other end was saying, but he laughed lightly, his eyes shining with pleasure.

“Okay, I know. See you next week, you choose the place.” Seeing his nephew walk in without knocking, Du Xulang furrowed his brow and had to end the call.

Zhou Wenjing subtly observed him, curious about the person who could make his uncle so gentle.

“Uncle, did you find a ‘aunt’ for me?” He teased cautiously.

Du Xulang was obviously pleased by the word "aunt," laughing lowly before nodding, “Yes, I found you an aunt,” then added with a mischievous tone, “Once I settle things with him, I’ll introduce you two. You must get along well.”

So it’s not settled yet? Zhou Wenjing secretly breathed a sigh of relief, responding obediently. He had already learned Du Xulang’s true identity, and his first reaction was disbelief, then surprise, followed by fear. After a year or two of adjustment, he gradually returned to the easygoing relationship they had at first.

With Du Xulang’s help, Zhou Wenjing founded his own company, which was now in its growth phase with a very promising future. He was no longer the illegitimate child of the Zhou family who could be easily disregarded. In J country, even business moguls would respectfully call him “Young Master Jing” when they met him.

All of this was thanks to Du Xulang. If Du Xulang were to form his own family, would he still treat this nephew, with no blood relation, so wholeheartedly? Could his wife and children accept his existence?

Zhou Wenjing was naturally suspicious and lacked a sense of security, so he harbored some wariness toward Du Xulang, who was so unreserved in giving to him.

The flicker of doubt in his eyes did not escape Du Xulang’s sharp observation, and Du Xulang couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Even though Zhou Yunsheng had learned of his true identity, he treated him with no difference from before. Although his nephew tried to hide it, he still couldn’t conceal the fear and attempts to please in his actions. Du Xulang had once thought Zhou Yunsheng was inferior to his nephew, but now he realized he had misjudged.

Zhou Wenjing, feeling uneasy under Du Xulang's gaze, had no choice but to open the notebook he had brought with him to change the subject, “Today is the last day of the ‘Business Battle’ finals. I want to win first place and show it to you.”

“Oh? It’s already the last day?” Du Xulang, as expected, put aside his thoughts and walked over to focus on the screen.

“Business Battle” was an online game released by Noah Universe, very popular among business people. Due to its excellent production and realistic environment and details, many business tycoons even forced their children to compete in the game to sharpen their skills. This year marked the two-year anniversary of the game, and the game organizers held a true "business battle," but only young people under 25 were allowed to participate.

The competition was held in the Haicheng copy, and lasted for thirty days. Each player initially received a 10,000 yuan startup fund, and after the countdown ended, the computer would select the winner based on their overall performance. Simply put, the one who made the most money would win.

Zhou Wenjing was a loyal fan of “Business Battle” and a powerful player with top skills. So far, he had maintained the first position. The game had a huge global user base, and those who stood out were usually extraordinary, with impressive backgrounds. While there were some anonymous participants, those who participated with real names were all people of great power—either business newcomers who started from scratch or second-generation heirs of chaebols or large groups.

No one had expected the obscure Zhou family’s illegitimate son to outshine everyone and secure the first place. It was known that Zhou Wenjing’s older brother, Zhou Wen'ang, had been eliminated the day after being praised by Zhou’s father, while Zhou Yunsheng had never appeared, perhaps out of fear of embarrassment.

With a sense of superiority, Zhou Wenjing pointed at the map and explained, “The reclamation project between Shuangba Island and Qing Shui Bay is now completed, and this place will become an important commercial port. The once insignificant Qing Shui Warehouse will greatly increase in value and become the center of logistics. When the government announced the launch of the reclamation project, I had already acquired Xinglong Group. Xinglong Group holds 20% of Qing Shui Warehouse’s shares, so I indirectly control it. The biggest prize in the Haicheng copy is already mine.”

Du Xulang glanced at the data on the screen and raised an eyebrow, “You seem to be celebrating a bit early. This person holds 22% of the shares, which is more than you.”

Zhou Wenjing followed his finger and saw that a player named "deicide" had posted a shareholding certificate in the chat, with a glaring 22% written in bright red letters.

“How could this be? Where did this deicide come from? I’ve never seen him before!” Zhou Wenjing was shocked, quickly pulling up the player’s profile and finding that the player’s performance had been average, but his investments were astonishing. He had invested in various industries, such as food, technology, real estate, and entertainment. Though there were no huge profits, his investments were all stable and profitable. In just twenty-nine days, he had quietly accumulated a massive fortune. His rank was just outside the top ten, but the rankings only showed the top ten players’ movements, which is why Zhou Wenjing had never been on guard.

Du Xulang stared at deicide's transaction records, raising an eyebrow, “Looks like his vision is even longer-term than yours. When the government sent the first survey team to Qing Shui Bay, he had already started buying shares in Qing Shui Warehouse. Truly a surprising move.”

If he doesn’t move, it’s nothing. But once he moves, it’s game over, typical of certain people’s style. Du Xulang chuckled with interest.

Zhou Wenjing sneered, “Even if he has two extra points, so what? My Xinglong Group focuses on real estate and finance. We’ve already built a strong relationship with Guomao Bank. As long as I talk to the chairman (NPC) of Guomao Bank, they will terminate all financial dealings with deicide. As long as he doesn’t want to go bankrupt, he will be forced to give up his shares. This is how the business world works—what you hold in your hands isn’t necessarily yours.”

Du Xulang smirked meaningfully, casually flicking off the cigarette ash. His nephew was very talented, but he was probably still no match for Yunsheng.

Zhou Wenjing quickly reached an agreement with the chairman of Guomao Bank, but an unexpected twist occurred. The second-ranked Shenghe Group announced its entry into the battle for Qing Shui Warehouse. Shenghe Group, a shipping industry giant in Haicheng, was led by Lei Shenghe, the great-grandson of the world’s shipping tycoon, Lei Shizu.

Shenghe Group had a large investment in Guomao Bank, and Lei Shenghe was an honorary vice chairman of the bank, with a much closer relationship than Zhou Wenjing. His powerful involvement caused the competition to heat up rapidly.

Inoue Xiu Shan, Du Xulang’s personal assistant, had been keeping an eye on the competition and, seeing the boss’s nephew competing in the office, couldn’t help but come in to observe.

“Young people today are getting more and more impressive. It makes us old folks nervous. Deicide, the ‘god killer,’ talks big, but his strength is the weakest. Holding 22% of the shares is like holding a hot potato. He will probably become the cannon fodder in the battle between Xinglong Group and Shenghe Group. His previous performance was steady, but acquiring Qing Shui Warehouse could be his biggest mistake. This is the true face of ‘insatiable greed.’ In business, you need courage, but also a calm mind.” He gave his opinion to the guest.

Zhou Wenjing nodded in agreement, while Du Xulang forcefully snuffed out his cigarette and gave Inoue Xiu Shan a meaningful glance. Inoue Xiu Shan crossed his arms, feeling a little cold.

At this very moment, Zhou Yunsheng was sitting in front of his computer screen, noticing that Lei Shenghe, as he had predicted, had joined the competition. He immediately tapped into the private chat channel. The two had a brief meeting and finally reached a consensus.

On the other side, Zhou Wenjing was surprised to see that Deicide had transferred his shares to Lei Shenghe at the low price of 30 yuan per share, and Lei Shenghe persuaded Guomao Bank to allow Deicide to swap his shares for 46% of the shares in its subsidiary, Jialing Group. As a result, Deicide officially became the largest shareholder of Jialing Group and took control of its board of directors.

Jialing Group is in the food manufacturing industry, with much less potential than the future goldmine that is Qing Shui Warehouse, but its market value is at least 6 billion yuan when calculated.

When Deicide acquired shares in Qing Shui Warehouse, the stock price was still very low. Even at the low price of 30 yuan per share, he still made a 360 million yuan profit from Lei Shenghe, and all of that 360 million was used to acquire Jialing Group. In other words, he bought 6 billion yuan worth of assets without spending a single penny.

When the announcement was made, everyone was completely stunned, finally realizing that Deicide probably had his eyes set not on Qing Shui Warehouse, but on Jialing Group from the beginning. However, he didn’t make a direct move but cleverly played around, intending to acquire Jialing Group without spending a penny.

“This move of getting something for nothing is truly brilliant!” Inoue Hideyama adjusted his glasses, feeling his handsome face being slapped by Deicide.

Zhou Wenjing, holding back his anger, almost crushed the mouse in his hand. With Du Xulang watching him from the side, he suddenly felt the pressure increase and resorted to the most despicable means. Taking advantage of Lei Shenghe’s board meeting break, he announced on the world channel that he would acquire Qing Shui Warehouse’s shares at a price of 45 yuan per share, continuing until he had obtained 49.9% of the shares.

Why 49.9%? Because company law stipulates that if a shareholder owns more than 50% of the shares in a company, the company will enter a mandatory acquisition phase. In other words, once the 50% threshold is crossed, regardless of financial situation, the shareholder must buy up 100% of the shares from other shareholders, or face legal consequences.

This rule is to prevent hostile takeovers and protect the company’s interests.

The full acquisition of Qing Shui Warehouse would involve hundreds of billions of funds, and neither Xinglong Group nor Shenghe Group currently had that kind of capability.

As the acquisition continued at full speed, Zhou Yunsheng saw the private chat message from Lei Shenghe and smiled with satisfaction.

Zhou Wenjing’s shareholding was slowly rising, and he was about to secure victory, but Lei Shenghe announced on the world channel that he would acquire Qing Shui Warehouse’s shares at a price 10 yuan higher than Xinglong Group’s offer, continuing until he had obtained 49.9%. Observing shareholders flooded to Shenghe Group.

In the end, the acquisition battle ended with Xinglong Group’s disastrous defeat, and the countdown banners all turned to zero. The competition was over.

Zhou Wenjing wiped his face, ran his hand through his hair, and suddenly threw the mouse out of his hand. The computer screen rapidly changed frames, clearly tallying the comprehensive data of the contestants, ultimately determining the winner.

Du Xulang patted his nephew’s shoulder reassuringly and looked at Inoue Hideyama. “Who do you think the final winner is?”

“It has to be Lei Shenghe. He’s the grandson of the shipping tycoon, surpassing even the best of his generation.” Inoue Hideyama was certain.

“No, it’s Deicide.” Du Xulang pointed to the screen. “The final acquisition battle involved nearly 9 billion yuan in funds. Although Lei Shenghe’s shipping company has a high market value, his liquidity is low. Where would he get 9 billion so quickly?”

“Borrowed?” Inoue Hideyama thought of a possibility, and his heart skipped a beat. “My God, young people today are terrifying.”

Seeing Inoue Hideyama’s face contorted with amazement, Du Xulang smiled. “Yes, the final 9 billion was borrowed. As for who he borrowed it from, you can take a look.”

At this moment, Deicide’s profile showed a new update. In the total assets section, there was suddenly a 20% stake in Qing Shui Warehouse. He had finally taken a big bite out of the biggest cake in Haicheng, skillfully manipulating everyone into his plans.

“This is the real winner.” Du Xulang walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, his eyes full of admiration and fascination. Zhou Yunsheng’s name was like a spell, and once he stepped into it, he couldn’t escape.

“Unbelievable, this person’s brain is something else. Most people plan ten steps ahead, but he’s already completed the entire game before even starting. His every move was anticipated. A hundred percent success rate in investments, far-reaching business vision, and outstanding strategic ability—this person is a genius. He might one day rival you, boss!” Inoue Hideyama was completely in awe.

Du Xulang chuckled.

“Success in the virtual world doesn’t mean success in the real world.” Zhou Wenjing pushed his leather chair back and walked out, speaking coldly. “If he’s so capable, let’s see if he can make a few billion in the real world. There are plenty of geniuses out there, but how many can actually rise to the top?”

He had founded Zongda Group, primarily in real estate and finance, and money flowed in quickly. In just two years, his assets had exceeded hundreds of millions. He was still in his third year of university, under 20 years old, and compared to most young people, he was undoubtedly a standout.

His immense success gradually turned his already proud nature into arrogance. He couldn’t accept that a nameless small fry had taken away a victory that should have been within his grasp.

Du Xulang watched his nephew’s hasty departure with a disappointed shake of his head. As the saying goes, there are always people better than you. His nephew, although excellent in reality and with strong business acumen, was far behind Zhou Yunsheng. Zhou Yunsheng’s company, Noah Universe, had long since surpassed the once-famous Ruir Technology, becoming a giant in the IT industry, with software developed by them deeply integrated into various industries, making life and work more convenient for people.

Humanity had inevitably entered the information age, and the profits generated by the information industry were unimaginable for those who hadn’t ventured into this field. Money was secondary; what was truly terrifying was how it silently controlled people’s lives. Noah Universe’s strength was already on par with major business tycoons like the Du family.

While disappointed in his nephew, Du Xulang also felt proud of his beloved one. He logged into his account and initiated a private chat with Deicide.

Inoue Hideyama, who had been ready to leave, stopped in disbelief when he saw his boss’s actions. “Do you know the great god? Can you introduce him to me?” He had gone from a passerby to a fervent fan of Deicide.

Du Xulang didn’t answer, his gaze fixed on the computer screen. Sure enough, the handsome face he longed for appeared on the other side. The person was pouring red wine, his white shirt unbuttoned at the top to reveal his sexy collarbones.

“Zhou Yunsheng!” Inoue Hideyama, who often helped his boss buy gifts, naturally recognized the young man, and a look of realization appeared on his face. At such a young age, he was already as wealthy as a nation, and entirely self-made. His talent was enough to eclipse all the younger generation. Before, Inoue Hideyama had only a vague impression of him as “outstanding,” but after this intense battle, he truly realized how powerful he was.

No wonder he was the one to capture the boss’s heart, who was known for his appeal to both men and women. Inoue Hideyama adjusted his glasses, silently marveling.

“Congratulations.” Du Xulang’s hot gaze lingered on the other’s collarbones and Adam’s apple.

Zhou Yunsheng smiled, raised his wine glass, and shook it in front of the camera. “Cheers.”

“What’s that wine you’re drinking?” Du Xulang, also pouring wine, asked as he did so.

“1992 Royal Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon.”

Priced at 500,000 A-country currency per bottle, over 3 million C-country currency, or over 59 million J-country currency. Truly a man who knows how to enjoy life. Du Xulang chuckled softly, setting down his glass and sighing. “My wine is not as good as yours, but how about you treat me?”

Zhou Yunsheng narrowed his eyes, thinking for a moment, then gestured to the camera. “Then come over, I’ll not only treat you to wine, but also breakfast.”

The young man’s voice was deep and husky, filled with countless suggestive undertones, causing Du Xulang’s heart to race. Struggling to maintain his composure, he asked, “Are you serious? You know what will happen before you treat me to breakfast?”

“Don’t know why I’d treat you? After chasing me for so long, you’re scared to get serious?” The young man raised an eyebrow, his face blurred by the wine, making it all the more alluring.

If he held back any longer, he wouldn’t be a man! Under Inoue Hideyama’s stunned gaze, Du Xulang rushed out of the office without even putting on his jacket, knocking over his leather chair with a loud crash.

On the other side of the screen, Zhou Yunsheng’s delighted laugh echoed.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 1.7

Waking up at exactly five o’clock, Zhou Yunsheng instinctively tightened his embrace around the warm body beside him. The man’s hair was messy, and his sharp, handsome features radiated a lazy satisfaction after intimate moments. His eyes, which always gleamed with a dangerous light, were tightly closed at this moment, tempting Zhou Yunsheng to lean down and kiss him.

As a villain controlled by a system, and with a pure gay attribute, Zhou Yunsheng's previous days had not been easy. He was often forced to "fall in love" with certain people, even engaging in the most intimate of actions. Every time this happened, the system would take control of his body. Many times, when he woke up and saw the female protagonist either angrily scolding him, attempting to kill herself, or planning to take them both down together, he actually wanted to yell at her even more, to seek death and despair even more, and to take them both down together even more than she did.

The past was too painful to look back on. Zhou Yunsheng pinched the man’s sexy and determined jaw, kissing him deeply.

Du Xulang had already woken up the moment his lover opened his eyes. But he knew his lover had a habit of gazing at him for a long time before getting out of bed, then giving him a kiss full of intense emotion. His lover’s appearance was handsome and gentle, always carrying a faint smile at the corner of his lips. But after getting to know him, one would realize that he had a very strong personality.

This led to their intimate moments often resembling a battle for control, intense, passionate, and fulfilling. Once he experienced it, he couldn’t get enough.

He chuckled softly, grabbing his lover’s flexible waist and pressing back... His attitude toward this relationship had never been more serious. Initially, he hadn’t thought about forever, but as time passed, his lover's appearance went from youthful to mature, gradually blooming with a dazzling radiance, making his thoughts linger on him for a long time. He suddenly realized that maybe he should do something to permanently keep him, to possess him honorably.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t know what Du Xulang was thinking. He only felt that the man was particularly excited today and didn’t stop for more than two hours in bed. Fortunately, his body had been modified; otherwise, his waist would have broken.

They showered together and were about to order takeout when Zhou Yunsheng’s phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID, and his brow involuntarily raised—it was Zhou Wen'ang.

"Okay, I’ll be right back." After silently listening to the call, he threw the phone aside and started packing his bags.

"What’s wrong?" Du Xulang felt that his lover's expression was a bit off.

"Zhou Hao is dying; he wants me to come back." Zhou Yunsheng answered without looking up, his face showing no sadness over the impending death of a family member, only anticipation and amusement. He glanced at the smart wristband on his wrist. The progress bar at the top left corner had remained at 50% since he founded Noah Universe, and it hadn't changed since then.

And Zhou Hao’s death was the tragic turning point in the original host's life. Only by destroying this period of time could he completely disrupt the world’s development.

He stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, suddenly feeling a surge of excitement—uncontrollable excitement.

They packed their bags and booked flights, arriving at the Zhou family home that evening.

"Big brother, you're back!" Zhou Wen'ang hurriedly greeted, embracing his long-lost brother tightly, his eyes red and glistening with tears. If it weren’t for Du Xulang's investigation, he might have been fooled by the excellent acting.

"Where's dad?" Zhou Yunsheng pushed him aside, his expression calm, his tone even somewhat indifferent. It wasn't that he couldn't act; it was just that with the power to crush his opponents, he no longer bothered to disguise his feelings.

"He's upstairs. The doctor said he won't survive tonight, so I brought him home. He felt uneasy lying in the hospital." Zhou Wen'ang spoke as he led them upstairs, casually asking, "By the way, why is Assistant Du here? Did you meet abroad?"

Before Zhou Yunsheng could answer, Du Xulang spoke slowly, "It wasn’t by chance. We’re currently in a relationship. I’m Yunsheng’s boyfriend."

To come out to his father-in-law on the brink of death... Du Xulang must be planning to make him die with regret! Wait, why is it father-in-law and not father? Zhou Yunsheng silently complained in his heart, his cold eyes finally lighting up with a smile, nodding in agreement.

Zhou Wen'ang almost missed a step and nearly fell down the stairs. Fortunately, the old butler beside him steadied him.

"You go ahead. I'll wait outside." When they reached the door, Du Xulang had no intention of entering to visit.

Zhou Yunsheng wasn’t bothered. He touched his handsome face, then strolled inside. The dimly lit room was filled with the smell of medicine and the ominous atmosphere of impending death. Zhou Hao was covered in tubes, his thin chest barely rising.

"Dad, Big Brother's back." Zhou Wen'ang shouted a couple of times near Zhou's father’s ear. Seeing that he didn’t respond, he was almost eager to drag Zhou Yunsheng out.

"Yunsheng’s back?" As they were about to leave the room, Zhou’s father suddenly woke up, struggling to speak. "Yunsheng, I’m sorry, I’m sorry for your mother. It was I who caused her death..."

"Dad, those things are in the past. We don’t blame you. Mom couldn’t handle it herself, it had nothing to do with you. Don’t worry, don’t think too much." Zhou Wen'ang quickly rushed to the bedside and pinched Zhou’s father’s fingers forcefully. They say that when someone is about to die, their words are good, and when Zhou’s father strongly insisted on having Zhou Yunsheng called back, Zhou Wen'ang sensed that Zhou’s father might reveal the truth about the past.

He had already come this far, with only one step left. How could he let his years of planning fail?

Zhou’s father winced in pain. Seeing the pleading look in his younger son’s eyes, he finally decided to take the secret to his grave. When Zhou's father fell back into unconsciousness and couldn’t be awakened no matter what, Zhou Wen'ang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Zhou Yunsheng stood three meters away, watching with a mocking smile on his lips.

Meanwhile, Zhou Wenjing hurriedly arrived at the Zhou family home, and was startled to find his uncle there.

"I'll explain later. Do you want to go in and see?" Du Xulang pointed toward the bedroom door with a cigarette between his fingers, while heading toward the study next door, blatantly eavesdropping.

Zhou Father's bedroom and the study were connected by a thin door. Sitting in the study, one could clearly hear the noise coming from the other side. Zhou Wenjing hesitated for a moment before following him into the room.

Zhou Yunsheng's hearing was far superior to ordinary people, so he naturally heard their footsteps but paid no attention. He sat on the single sofa beside the bed, casually speaking, "Why did Father say sorry to me? Because he murdered my mother?"

Zhou Father suddenly opened his eyes and began to cough violently.

Zhou Wenang barely suppressed his panic. While helping Zhou Father pat his chest, he scolded, "Big Brother, what nonsense are you talking about? Mom committed suicide."

"What right do you have to call her 'Mom'? Are you her son?" Zhou Yunsheng leaned comfortably back in his chair, crossing his long legs.

Zhou Wenang's face twisted in anger. The two people eavesdropping next door also couldn't help but breathe more heavily. The heart monitor emitted a long beep before stopping completely. Zhou Father was scared to death. But no one in the room moved or even glanced in his direction. At this point, Zhou Wenang gave up his pretense, slowly sat down across from Zhou Yunsheng, pushed his hair back, revealing a face full of hostility.

"How did you know?"

"Your thumb gave you away." Zhou Yunsheng sneered. "Your thumb is missing a segment, it's short and bald, very ugly, just like that woman. It's a dominant gene that will definitely be passed on to the next generation. But Mom and Zhou Hao both have normal hands. I don't need to explain what that means, right?"

Zhou Wenang forcefully bent his thumb, and after a long while, he laughed lowly. "So what if you know? You can't do anything to me now. The Zhou family is mine. Oh, right, you can try to get Yang Xi's inheritance back or beg the Yang family to deal with me. But unfortunately, you probably don't know yet, the Yang Group is currently undertaking the underwater tunnel project between Qindao City and Rongcheng, and the Zhou Group has promised to invest 2 billion in the Yang family. If the Zhou family withdraws the investment, the Yang family will go bankrupt, completely."

As if he found his words amusing, Zhou Wenang's low laugh turned into a loud one. The days of living in fear would finally be over once the Yang Group collapsed, how could he not feel elated?

But Zhou Yunsheng's reaction disappointed him. The young man still sat steadily, waiting for him to finish laughing before asking, "So, did Zhou Hao kill my mother?"

"Guess," Zhou Wenang cleverly didn't respond.

"You've been trying to deal with me all these years, right? That poisoned cigarette that Elsa gave me was actually meant for me?"

"Such a pity." Zhou Wenang smiled ambiguously. At critical moments, he wouldn't allow the other person to catch any dirt on him, trying to bait him into making a confession and secretly recording it—no chance.

Zhou Yunsheng also smiled, walking over and patting Zhou Wenang's cheek gently, his tone exceedingly tender, "Enjoy this final celebration, my dear brother." With that, he opened the door and left.

The two people in the study were struggling to digest the bombshell they had just overheard. Du Xulang recalled another illegitimate child of the Zhou family who had died, remembering that the birth dates of the two children were very similar, and finally piecing together many suspicious details. To see through such a perfect scam—Yunsheng's insight was terrifying. When did he discover it? What did he feel at that time? His father killed his mother, and his own brother turned out to be his enemy's child—what kind of emotions did he experience as he made his way to this point?

No wonder he felt no affection for Zhou Hao, no wonder his attitude toward Zhou Wenang had changed so dramatically. Du Xulang's heart ached unbearably.

Zhou Wenjing also had a very ugly expression. He had never expected that the person he had been guarding against for years was not his real enemy. All the kindness, comfort, and gifts... they were all fake. All these years, he had been like a fool, played with by Zhou Wenang, while Zhou Father never once mentioned him.

At this moment, he wished he could strangle Zhou Wenang. When his anger subsided, he walked toward Zhou Yunsheng's room. The servants were coming and going, systematically preparing for the upcoming funeral.

"Your mother wasn't driven to death by my mother." After knocking on the door, he spoke bluntly.

Zhou Yunsheng raised an eyebrow.

"So I don't owe you anything." Zhou Wenjing had to admit he felt relieved when he said this. His feelings for Zhou Yunsheng were complicated. The hatred accumulated over more than ten years couldn't be completely erased, but he also felt sorry for him.

"What do you mean?" Zhou Yunsheng patiently pressed.

"I just want to tell you that I won't take revenge on you, but I also won't help you. From now on, you're on your own." Because Zhou Yunsheng had always kept a low profile, Zhou Wenjing had always thought he was a penniless student. Now, with billions to his name, Zhou Wenjing naturally looked down on him.

The humiliation Zhou Yunsheng had inflicted on him back then was something he could never forget. Now, sparing him out of pity was already the greatest mercy, and he couldn't ask for more.

He said these things to avoid the day when his identity as the president of the Zongda Group and the nephew of the Du family head would be exposed, and Zhou Yunsheng would shamelessly cling to him. He naturally assumed that his uncle would appear at the Zhou family to support him.

Zhou Yunsheng was a bit speechless. Zhou Wenjing stared at him for a while, then turned and left.

"Is he too full of himself? What was that expression and tone? Does he think I'm a pitiful stray dog? That not making things worse for me is his biggest help?" Zhou Yunsheng grabbed Du Xulang's tie and pulled it tight.

Du Xulang hurriedly held his lover's waist and sincerely apologized. "It's my fault, I didn't teach him well. Babe, let's talk in bed."

Zhou Yunsheng: "..."

It seemed that everyone had forgotten to mourn for Zhou Father's passing.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


Chapter 1.8

The funeral of Mr. Zhou was both grand and hurried. After lying in state for three days, the burial took place in a rush. On the second day of the funeral, the lawyer brought Mr. Zhou’s will, which shocked everyone. Mr. Zhou bequeathed all his property, including 30% of Zhou Group's shares, to his youngest son, Zhou Wen'ang, while his eldest and second sons received nothing.

The second son, Zhou Wenjing, was an illegitimate child and had never been favored by Mr. Zhou. It was not surprising that he did not inherit anything, but what was strange was that even the eldest son received nothing. When it was revealed that even Mrs. Zhou’s inheritance was entirely left to the youngest son, people could not help but comment on how biased the Zhou couple was. How would Zhou Yunsheng, who had no assets, live in the future? Had they not considered this?

“Mr. Zhou, please sign.” The lawyer placed a thick stack of documents in front of Zhou Wen'ang for him to sign, and the others could only stare blankly.

“This is impossible. How could Zhou Hao leave nothing for Yunsheng? He had said before he passed that he would leave Zhou Group to Yunsheng.” Old Lady Yang shouted in disbelief, while Mr. Yang looked at his jubilant grandson with a look of doubt. As in-laws, they were invited to the will reading.

Zhou Yunsheng smiled and patted his grandmother’s aging hand. Although their relationship had grown distant, the care the elderly couple had shown him had never changed.

“How could it be impossible? He has been abroad for six or seven years, and never even called home. It was I who stayed by Dad’s side and helped manage the company. Isn’t it natural that Dad left the inheritance to me?” Zhou Wen'ang no longer showed the previous respect for the elderly couple.

“But Xi’er’s inheritance was already given to you. Your elder brother has nothing. How will he live in the future...” Old Lady Yang still felt it was very unfair.

“Whether he lives or dies has nothing to do with me. It’s getting late. Please leave. Oh, and starting tomorrow, I will be the new president of Zhou Group. I’ve decided to withdraw investments from Yang Group, so please be prepared.” Zhou Wen'ang smiled with a fake grin as he urged them to leave.

“You brat, what are you saying? Do you know the consequences of withdrawing investments from Yang Group? Do you want to bankrupt Yang Group?” Mr. Yang asked in a deep voice, his brows furrowed with anger. He could not believe that his grandson, whom he had once thought so filial, could be so heartless. What had the Yang family ever done to him to deserve such treatment?

Zhou Wenjing, who had been expressionless all along, finally showed his first smile in days. He knew that the will had nothing to do with him. He had come today purely to watch the drama. The Yang family had never respected him, and now, seeing Zhou Wen'ang tear his face with the man who had been cherished for twenty years, it was truly a case of “dog biting dog.”

Zhou Yunsheng remained composed throughout, patting his grandfather’s shoulder lightly, and smiled, “Let him withdraw his investments. Grandfather, grandmother, let's go.”

“But…” How could Mr. Yang leave? If Zhou Group withdrew investments, the underwater tunnel project of Yang Group would face a huge cash shortage, causing the project to be delayed, or even abandoned. In such a case, not only would Yang Group’s initial investment of over 10 billion be lost, but they would also have to pay huge breach of contract fines and bank loans. Selling off all the assets under Yang Group wouldn’t even cover the hole.

Zhou Wen'ang was trying to destroy the Yang family!

“Even if you beg him, he won’t change his mind. What he wants is for Yang Group to be destroyed. Grandfather, grandmother, come with me, I have a way,” Zhou Yunsheng feared that speaking too directly would upset the elderly couple, so he firmly led them away.

"You have a way? What way do you have?" Zhou Wen'ang and Zhou Wenjing both scoffed internally.

As soon as Mr. Zhou passed away, the cooperative relationship between Zhou Group and Yang Group collapsed. The new president of Zhou Group, Zhou Wen'ang, announced that he would withdraw investments from Yang Group’s underwater tunnel project, with no explanation given. Yang Group was facing its biggest crisis, and if not handled properly, they would be on the verge of bankruptcy.

However, no one extended a helping hand. Everyone was waiting for Yang Group to collapse so they could take over the underwater tunnel project, which was expected to generate hundreds of billions in profits, at a minimal price. This was the nature of business—driven by profit, where friends and even family could be betrayed.

But what was surprising was that Mr. Yang seemed remarkably calm. He returned home, ate as usual, slept as usual, and showed no signs of the panic the outside world expected. The Yang family's children also seemed unfazed. Yang Zhenhai, the current head of the family, had even spent millions on jewelry, showing no sign of financial trouble.

“Oh, my nephew is the president of Noah Universal, why should I worry? Do you know Noah Universal? It’s ranked first in the Fortune 500,” Mrs. Yang said, staring at the large diamond ring on her finger, smiling brightly.

The sales assistant responded obediently, but thought to herself, You have two nephews. One inherited Zhou Group, and the other is a penniless nobody. How can you have another nephew who is the world’s wealthiest? Dream on.

Although the Yang family's reaction was strange, Zhou Wen'ang had no time to care. He was under attack by Zhou Wenjing. He never imagined that the illegitimate son he once manipulated would now be a billionaire, hoping to compete with him for Zhou Group.

Zhou Wenjing first spread the news that Zhou Wen'ang was not the biological son of Yang Xi, then hinted that Zhou Hao had murdered Yang Xi and was after his inheritance. He also publicly released the DNA comparison between Yang Xi and Zhou Wen'ang, prompting the police to launch an investigation. The two scandals shook the public, and Zhou Group’s stock, which had already dropped after Mr. Zhou’s death, hit the limit down.

Meanwhile, Zhou Wenjing took this opportunity to acquire scattered shares, quickly becoming the largest shareholder of Zhou Group.

Zhou Yunsheng, however, remained unshaken. His goal was for the two of them to fight to the death. He never intended to fight Zhou Wen'ang in court for the inheritance; from the start, he decided to make sure they both ended up with nothing. As for Zhou Wenjing, once the biggest winner, he was about to teach him a practical lesson in what it meant to be the “mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the yellow bird behind.” This would be a lesson in futility.

The despair, heartbreak, and helplessness that Zhou Yunsheng had once endured would never happen again.
After several months, the rivalry between the two brothers of the Zhou family had escalated to a boiling point. Both of them currently held 30% of the shares of Zhou Corporation, and all the shareholders they could persuade had already chosen sides. The final 15% of the shares, which would decide the outcome, were surprisingly in the hands of the head of the Du family.

Seven years ago, he had already become a shareholder of Zhou Corporation, but no one had noticed. Zhou Wen'ang was too preoccupied with other matters to consider the implications of this move by the head of the Du family. He only knew that if he could convince him to sell the shares to him, or to support him at the shareholders' meeting, he would be the ultimate winner.

Unfortunately, Zhou Wenjing and he seemed to have a telepathic connection. As soon as they stepped out of the elevator, the two of them met in the corridor.

"Please come in. Coffee or green tea?" Inoue Hideyama, speaking fluent Mandarin, led them into the CEO's office.

"Coffee (Green tea)." Their answers were completely opposite.

The leather chair swiveled around, and a tall, imposing man with sharp features was sitting there, smoking a cigar, his hair slicked back, revealing a handsome yet devilish face. He exhaled a cloud of smoke, but the sharp gleam in his dark eyes could not be concealed.

Zhou Wenjing sat upright as usual, but Zhou Wen'ang, startled, knocked over his hot coffee. What alarmed him more than the man's identity was Zhou Wenjing's respectful address—he had called the man "uncle!"

"Well, you two are teaming up against me," Zhou Wen'ang muttered, knowing that staying any longer would only lead to humiliation. He covered his burned hand and stormed out.

When he said "teaming up," he was referring to Zhou Wenjing, Zhou Yunsheng, and Du Xulang joining forces, as he knew that Du Xulang was Zhou Yunsheng's boyfriend. With such an influential figure on their side, it was no wonder that the Yang family had raised 2 billion yuan in the shortest time to fill the gap.

However, Zhou Wenjing did not know the full story and thought he was talking about himself and his uncle teaming up. After Zhou Wen'ang left, he affectionately said, "Uncle, do you still want that 15% of the shares? If not, sell them to me, I'll offer a discount."

Du Xulang did not respond immediately but instead asked, "Wenjing, have you ever thought that Zhou Corporation was meant to belong to Yunsheng?"

Zhou Wenjing suppressed his inner hatred and forced a cheerful smile. "Uncle, you once taught me that business is like a battlefield, and if you want something, you have to fight for it. As the saying goes, survival of the fittest, if he wants Zhou Corporation, he can come and compete with me, and we'll see who has the ability."

Du Xulang’s inexplicable support for Zhou Yunsheng made Zhou Wenjing feel a sense of danger.

After a brief silence, Du Xulang nodded. "You're right. Survival of the fittest, whoever has the ability, Zhou Corporation belongs to them."

"So, you’ll just watch and not intervene?" Zhou Wenjing, still feeling uneasy, asked.

"I won't intervene."

"As for the shares..." Zhou Wenjing pressed further. He was afraid that his uncle might give the shares to Zhou Yunsheng. Not confronting Zhou Yunsheng didn’t mean he would let him have it easy. He had already sworn to make him lose everything.

"I'll sell you the 15% shares at 35 yuan per share," Du Xulang offered a reasonable price.

Zhou Wenjing was pleased and immediately took out a check to fill in the numbers. Inoue Hideyama escorted the young man to the elevator, watching his smug face disappear behind the doors. He couldn't help but sigh. "Foolish child, he doesn't even know he's being played by the boss. He thinks the boss's refusal to help everyone is fairness, but in reality, it's just to cover up his bias. With his style, if he acts, it’ll definitely be a storm of blood."

He didn’t compete for the shares of Zhou Corporation not because he lacked the ability, but because he had already planned to destroy Zhou Corporation. Even if he got his hands on those 15% shares, they would eventually become useless.

The boss knew the truth, but for the sake of his lover’s plan, he said nothing and sold a pile of worthless shares to his nephew at an exorbitant price. He really is heartless when it comes to the opposite sex—oh wait, not just the opposite sex, but he’s also heartless in general...

 Chapter 1 .9

Zhou Yunsheng was taking a bath, when a strong body suddenly came up behind him, and his slightly rough palms wandered around his waist and abdomen, slowly exploring downwards. ......

He let out a moving moan, enjoying himself while asking intermittently, "You sold, shares, to him?"

"Uh-huh."The man gasped for breath, couldn't wait to attack the city, his lips gripped the back of his lover's long, white neck and sucked and grinded it, unable to stop.

"Well ......," Zhou Yunsheng stifled a grunt and mocked, "Selling a bunch of scrap paper to your nephew at a sky-high price, you can be a really good uncle."

"It is precisely because of being good to him that I sold it to him.He's had too smooth a ride and needs to learn to face setbacks.Otherwise, when the next time someone else strikes, he will most likely fall flat on his face and never be able to stand up again."

Zhou Yunsheng concentrated on enjoying himself and did not reply.As the protagonist of this world, Zhou Wenjing had naturally experienced ups and downs, but had survived them all with the help of Du Hulang and his many lovers.Du Hulang's tolerance towards him could be said to be unprincipled, where as now, knowing that there was a trap in front of him he still watched him jump into it, and even pushed him in the back.

The people surrounding Zhou Wenjing had changed and indirectly changed the world.Zhou Yunsheng narrowed his eyes and stared at the Smart Brain on his wrist that only he could see, hooking his lips in satisfaction.The progress bar in the upper left corner of the Think Brain had risen to 75%, not far from the booked target.

-------------------------------------

The two brothers of the Zhou family fought to the death, but the eldest son of the Zhou family was silent, and while the outside world sighed in admiration for Zhou Wenjing's rise, they also sighed at the eldest son's incompetence.If not for the mediocre ability of the eldest son, the Zhou Family Group would not have fallen into the hands of two illegitimate children.
Yes, although Zhou Wenjing became the new president, but Zhou Wenang after all owns 30% of Zhou's shares, is still a major shareholder, even if there is no decision-making power, every year to eat the dividends can also live comfortably at ease.

This day, Zhou Wenjing prepared to convene the first shareholders meeting since taking office, all have been present.The tall and beautiful secretary handed him the speech, and her fingertips painted with bright red cardamom gently scratched on the back of his hand suggestively.

Zhou Wenjing's lower body tightened slightly, but his face did not show at all, glancing at the speech was about to speak, the door of the conference room opened, a uniformed police officer walked in, took out his ID and opened his mouth seriously, "Hello, I'm Xing Guoquan, head of the Commercial Crimes Investigation Section, please Mr. Zhou Wen'an, Mr. Lin Deyi, Mr. Zhou Shicong, Mr. Zhu Gang, Mr. Yang Ruxuan, Mr. He Hongbo, please follow me to the police station to investigate the case....... follow me to the police station for investigation."

He arrested eleven people in one breath, all of them were Zhou Group's major shareholders, and took away all the financial staff and company account books, and asked Zhou Wenjing to go to the police station to assist in the investigation.Such a big move led to an uproar both inside and outside the industry, and Zhou's stock, which had just appreciated due to the successful reorganization, began to fall furiously again.

Twenty-four hours later, Zhou Wenjing was released, only to realize that someone hacked Zhou Wen'ang and Zhou Hao's computer, got their bribes, tax evasion, money laundering, illegal financing and other criminal evidence, anonymously mailed it to the police.Due to the reason that the amount of money involved was particularly huge, the police department quickly set up a task force to investigate the Zhou Group.

If these crimes were established, Zhou would face a series of problems such as asset freezing, delisting, and huge fines, and in more serious cases, it would lead to bankruptcy.In order to get Zhou, Zhou Wenjing had invested more than a billion dollars, if Zhou collapsed, his painstakingly managed Zongda Group would also be implicated, once the stock plummeted, billions of dollars of assets would evaporate into thin air, and the competitors would rise up and attack Zongda, dividing it up.

Zhou was not a piece of fat meat, but a quagmire that would be difficult to get out of.This was the biggest crisis Zhou Wenjing had ever encountered since he started his career in business, he felt confused and even a little scared, unconsciously he started the car and drove towards Du Hulang's company.

"Uncle, you must help me."The speaking voice ended abruptly, and he stared at the two people in front of him in dismay.

Two people deep in the leather sofa, hands are holding a glass of wine, tall man was slender and long youth pressed below, red wine splashed on his white shirt, resulting in close to the skin of the fabric outlined a broad and strong chest, combed a meticulous hair is now very messy, lining his already handsome and peerless face more and more sex - sensual.

He wrapped one hand around the youth's supple and powerful waist, one hand steadied the wine glass, in the past always flashed a dangerous light in the eyes now only remaining strong love and infatuation.

The youth took a sip of the wine and hung his head to cross over, the bright red wine dripping down the lips of the two men as they rolled over and over, the picture was charming and beautiful.

Zhou Wenjing was shocked by this scene in his mind, straight after several minutes before he spoke with difficulty, "What is your relationship?"

"What kind of relationship do you think we have?"Zhou Yunsheng felt a little spoiled, biting his lover's lips before sitting up straight, tilting his head back to drink the red wine in one go, because of the love affair, the peach blossom eyes that were already seductive now appeared even more colorful and extraordinary.

Zhou Wenjing stared at Du Hulang, saw that he did not deny, only possessive tightly embraced the youth, in this moment, suddenly understood everything.To bring down a commercial giant like the Zhou Clan, 
there must be a much larger force behind it as a push.Just who hated Zhou to the extent that they intended to destroy it?And who could mobilize such a huge force?

He had been pondering these two questions earlier, and when he arrived at the office and saw the scene just now, the answers were already coming out.


"So it's you, Zhou Yunsheng.For the sake of revenge, you can even sell your body, how lowly.I don't know how Yang Xi feels when he knows in his grave."He sneered.

Seeing him irritate his lover with his dead mother, Du Xu Lang's already cold features condensed a layer of frost.Zhou Yunsheng, however, did not get angry, but instead stroked his palm and laughed, as if he had heard a very funny joke.

Zhou Wenjing was angered by his reaction and interrogated, "What are you laughing at?"

"I'm laughing that you don't know the heights of heaven.Put out the cigarette."

The last sentence was obviously addressed to Du Hulang, who was preparing to light his cigar.Du Hulang's hand holding the lighter froze, then naturally put it down, threw the cigar into the trash can, and raised his hands in a surrendering gesture.Such an ingratiating attitude stung Zhou Wenjing's eyes more and more as he sat down across from the two men, pulled out his checkbook and sneered, "How much are you selling it for?I'll give it to you.You don't mess with my uncle."

Zhou Yunsheng pursed his lips and smiled more and more gently, but Du Hulang was furious and snapped, "Inoue, have someone send Wenjing out!"


Inoue Hidayama who hid outside the door to watch the show had to step in, making two bodyguards to frame boss's cheap nephew out.The two were not related by blood, even with Zhou Wenjing's mother being a childhood playmate with deep feelings, but coming all the way to C country to take care of it, and also giving money and contacts to let him set up his own business, boss had already paid enough.

What qualifications does Zhou Wenjing have to intervene in boss's emotional problems?Sure enough, he was too good to him, so he was getting unaware of it ah!Inoue Hideyama glanced at the furious Zhou Wenjing and secretly shook his head.

"Young Jing, take a look at this."Inoue Hidetama sent the person to the downstairs hall and turned on the amplifier display hanging in the hall.

The charismatic face of the internationally renowned host, Lydia, leapt out and spoke a large paragraph in slightly French-accented English.Zhou Wenjing was immediately captured with all his heart and soul, this turned out to be an exclusive interview with the president of Noah Group on cbs, the most famous channel in a country.Because he had returned to country c and was busy acquiring Zhou, he had surprisingly not been able to see it.

What kind of person is the president of Noah Group?He started his business from selling small software, at first, the registered fund of Noah Group was only a mere 400,000 dollars, but after just one and a half years, he created 400 million dollars of profit and successfully listed on the stock market.Noah Group is very young, so far this year, only the sixth anniversary of the establishment, but squeezed out many old plutocrats, ranked first in the world's top 100.The president of Noah Group acts extremely low-key, never appear in the media, but this does not prevent people from worshiping him.

He was the idol of the young generation of self-employed entrepreneurs, and the myths he created were unbreakable.Conceited as Zhou Wenjing, he also had to recognize the other party's toughness.

But what did he see?He actually saw Zhou Yunsheng's face on the screen!How was this possible!

“It turns out that the famous Deicide is actually Mr. Zhou,” Lydia said, looking very surprised, and immediately asked sharply, “Did you participate in the competition hosted by your own company and win first place with a brilliant performance because you had prior access to the copy materials? What you did is unfair to the other participants.”

So Deicide is him? Zhou Wenjing was utterly shocked. The intense battle to acquire Qing Shui Warehouse was so spectacular that the game video, once released, was revered by many business professionals as a textbook of business warfare. Every detail was repeatedly studied and analyzed. As a result, Deicide was elevated to the status of a god for his far-sighted business vision and decisive investment strategies. Everyone was curious about what kind of person could possess such extraordinary abilities and what his real identity was.

It turns out he is the CEO of Noah Global. Yes, he must have gotten the internal information in advance. All that talk about strategic brilliance and winning from a distance—it's all fake. He cheated! Zhou Wenjing refused to acknowledge his crushing defeat in their first encounter.

The Zhou Yunsheng on the screen smiled slightly, “I swear to God, I didn’t receive any information. My conditions were the same as all the other contestants’. I thought that the Noah Group behind me should be enough to demonstrate my strength.”

Lydia was taken aback, awkwardly smiling. Indeed, he developed Noah Group into such a massive enterprise in his early twenties. He led an era and changed people's lives. Just sitting here was enough to represent everything.

After that, Zhou Wenjing lost interest in continuing the interview. When he was feeling smug about the first money he earned, when he was proud of the brilliance of Zongda Group, Zhou Yunsheng had already left him far behind. He was someone who could stand on equal footing with high-ranking figures like Du Xulang, while Zhou Wenjing took secret pleasure in being addressed respectfully as “Jing Shao.” He even thought that the other person might betray him for the sake of the small Zhou family company and try to humiliate him with money.

Noah Group is a multinational company with annual profits in the billions, and Zhou Yunsheng would probably not even bother to bend down and pick up a check worth a few million if it dropped on the floor.

Such a gap, such a gap… it’s an immense difference…

Zhou Wenjing couldn’t find the words to describe his shame, and when he saw Inoue Hideyama squinting at him, his face turned red. He fled as if running away.


————————————————————————————————————————————

Chapter 1.10

The Zhou family group ultimately collapsed. This massive business ship, a long-established family that had stood for nearly a century, was reduced to ashes in just two months. And Zongda Group was inevitably implicated, with its stock price plummeting, commercial crime investigations piling up, and competitors launching a full-scale attack and suppression. All of this was enough to leave Zhou Wenjing at his wit's end.

Zhou Yunsheng stared at the intelligent wristband on his wrist, the progress bar reaching 99%. Because of the change in the original owner’s fate, this world was about to slip out of the main god’s control, heading down an unpredictable path.

There was still 1% chance to bring it back to the starting point, but Zhou Yunsheng didn’t mind. He could choose how long to stay in this world, so he had enough time to push the process forward.

Half a month ago, CBS's interview with the CEO of Noah Group was aired on C-National’s international news channel, and the true identity of this legendary figure was finally revealed. Meanwhile, the Yang family, which had been severely damaged and on the brink of bankruptcy, quickly rose to the ranks of C-National’s top families thanks to this opportunity.

Today was the 60th birthday of Mrs. Guo Lindanping, the wife of the Guo family head, Guo Liqian. As in-laws of the Guo family, the head of the Yang family, Yang Zhenhai, and his wife were invited to attend. Of course, the main purpose of the Guo family was to get acquainted with Zhou Yunsheng through the Yang family, as Yang Zhenhai was Zhou Yunsheng’s maternal uncle, and their relationship was very close.

According to the original fate, after the death of Zhou’s father, Zhou Wenjing and Zhou Wen’ang would join forces to deal with the Yang family, and the Yang family would quickly fall apart. Because of this, the original Zhou Yunsheng didn’t receive the protection of his maternal family and lived a miserable life.

But now, the Yang family was no longer the same.

When the Yang family faced a capital withdrawal crisis, Yang Zhenhai’s wife, Guo Shufang, had gone back home for help but was rejected by Guo Liqian. Guo Liqian had married Guo Lindanping and fathered two daughters. Eager for a son, he kept a mistress who gave birth to twins—a boy and a girl—and brought them into the family to be raised, nearly causing Guo Lindanping to suffer a heart attack.

The elderly Guo family couple were desperate for grandchildren and, without considering the feelings of Guo Lindanping and her daughters, insisted on adding the twins to the family tree. Guo Liqian even took the twins everywhere with him, raising them so that, at just twenty years old, they had already entered the board of directors, clearly positioning them as the next head of the Guo family.

It was easy to imagine how awkward the position of Guo Shufang and her daughters was in the Guo family. When she came home to seek help, the elderly couple had softened, but the mistress and her children persuaded Guo Liqian to demand conditions from the Yang family, offering to take the sea tunnel project at the lowest price.

Such actions were no different from taking advantage of someone’s misfortune. Guo Shufang cried in anger but was helpless. In the end, it was Guo Lindanping and her younger daughter who sold their jewelry and secretly gave her tens of millions. This was why, after her nephew filled the financial gap, Guo Shufang went on a shopping spree, buying jewelry, just to make up for her mother and sister.

In short, without Mrs. Guo Lindanping, the Yang and Guo families would have long become enemies.

Although Guo Lindanping was already sixty, she maintained herself very well. Her figure was full and her complexion rosy, exuding a peaceful beauty that came with the passage of time. Guo Liqian stood beside her, smiling and greeting the guests.

“The Yang family’s car has arrived.” Upon seeing the luxury car slowly approaching the gate, Guo Liqian’s eyes brightened. He quickly stepped forward with the twins. Guo Lindanping, supported by her younger daughter, followed at a slow pace, a hint of sarcasm curling at the corner of her mouth.

Yang Zhenhai and his wife walked along with a young man. The young man was handsome, with a gentle demeanor. His most striking feature was his long, almond-shaped eyes that seemed both indifferent and full of emotion when he looked at people, leaving an unforgettable impression.

“This must be your eldest nephew, right? Truly a fine young man!” Guo Liqian greeted warmly, trying to introduce the twins to the young man.

Zhou Yunsheng smiled faintly, nodded, and bypassed the three, taking Guo Lindanping’s hand and wishing her, “Happy birthday, Grandma.” His gesture clearly indicated who he was closer to.

“Why are you standing here? Come inside.” Guo Shufang affectionately linked arms with her nephew and mother and led them inside. Guo Liqian, feeling awkward, didn’t let the opportunity slip, leading the twins to follow closely behind. Their arrival caused all the guests to turn their heads and secretly praise the Guo family for marrying into such a good family.

“Yunsheng, let me introduce you. This is your cousin, Guo Zinan, who is currently learning under me. If you have time, you can teach him a few things. This is your cousin, Guo Baoyi, who is still studying vocal music at B University.” Guo Liqian persistently pushed the twins toward the young man.

Guo Baoyi smiled brightly and gracefully, while Guo Zinan frowned, his eyes filled with hostility.

Zhou Yunsheng glanced at him and smiled, “I heard you’re good friends with Wen’ang?”

Now, who didn’t know about the feud between the Zhou family’s three brothers? It was originally thought that the two illegitimate sons of the Zhou family had driven the legitimate eldest son to the edge of no return, but who could have predicted that the eldest son turned out to be an untouchable tyrant, easily crushing the Zhou family and leaving the two illegitimate sons in ruins.

Thus, no matter how handsome or gentle Zhou Yunsheng appeared, people couldn’t ignore his decisive and ruthless methods.

Thinking of this, Guo Zinan's face turned slightly pale, and Guo Liqun awkwardly interrupted, "He's still young, his horizons are narrow, so it's inevitable he might make some poor choices in friends. There's a saying, young people's mistakes are always forgivable."

Zhou Yunsheng smiled even more gently and commented, "Young people have the right to make mistakes, but not every mistake is worth forgiving. Mr. Guo, to be blunt, you should be stricter with the younger generation and not indulge their mistakes. Otherwise, they might end up like my younger brother Wen Ang, who didn't get out of prison until he was fifty, and by then, he had no chance to start over. Don’t you agree?"

On the surface, the Zhou family group collapsed due to involvement in a series of economic crimes, but secretly, who didn’t know it was the hand of the Zhou family's eldest son? This man could crush a giant like the Zhou family with just a snap of his fingers, and a third-rate family like the Guos wouldn't even last one round with him.

Guo Zinan’s body trembled uncontrollably, and Guo Liqun awkwardly nodded, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief. Guo Lindanping and her daughter continued to chat and drink casually, seemingly oblivious, but secretly pleased.

Just then, a series of surprised exclamations came from the door. The Guo family turned their heads to see a tall man walking in. He wore a perfectly tailored black suit, with a silver-gray handkerchief in his breast pocket. His hair was combed back, revealing a sharply chiseled face, and his narrow, sharp eyes made him appear intimidating.

The Du family had now risen to become the world’s leading arms dealer. After consolidating power, all forces were under Du Xulang’s control, and fewer people could pose a threat to him. Over the years, he had gradually emerged in the public eye.

In C country, most people had heard of his deeds. Although Guo Liqun couldn’t understand why such a prominent figure would show up uninvited, he immediately put down his wine glass and went to greet him, enjoying the envious gazes from the crowd.

However, Du Xulang bypassed him and walked straight towards the smiling young man, opening his arms. "Baby, why didn’t you wait for me?"

"I was out buying a birthday gift with Auntie." Zhou Yunsheng hugged him, then handed him his wine glass and grabbed another one for himself.

"Happy birthday, Grandma." After releasing his partner, Du Xulang gently hugged Mrs. Guo Lindanping. The affectionate address made her momentarily stunned.

"Mr. Du, you and Yunsheng are..."

"He’s my boyfriend." Zhou Yunsheng casually dropped a bombshell, causing Du Xulang to laugh in delight. He absolutely loved his partner’s boldness and straightforwardness. If you didn’t even have the courage to admit your love, how could you move forward together?

Guo Lindanping, not being a fool, quickly regained her composure, realizing her daughter had probably already known about it. On the other hand, Guo Liqun and the other two people turned pale and quickly excused themselves. With the Noah Group already making waves, adding the Du family’s financial power, this couple seemed to be the strongest combination in the world. Anyone who provoked them was bound to face dire consequences.

Thinking back to how they had ganged up on the Yang family, Guo Liqun deeply regretted it, cursing the mistress nearby and wishing he could slap her to death.

The onlookers, realizing that the Du family and Noah Global were about to cooperate on new weapon developments, suddenly had an epiphany—so the Guo family was just riding the coattails of the Yang family after all.

Not long after, Zhou Wenjing walked in, holding a pure-looking young girl. Now, after facing repeated setbacks, the Zongda Group was far from its former glory, and he no longer received the same attention as before. People simply referred to him as "young and accomplished." With Zhou Yunsheng holding the reins, what could his talents do?

Seeing the intimate drinking couple, Zhou Wenjing’s gaze darkened, while the young girl beside him shot a hateful glance.

"Isn't that your second uncle’s daughter?" Zhou Yunsheng gently swirled his wine.

The girl was one of Zhou Wenjing's many lovers, and her family background was quite complicated. Her father was Du Xulang’s second uncle, once the most likely to inherit the Du family’s fortune, but was suppressed by Du Xulang. The two had clashed many times, and their animosity ran deep, each wishing to destroy the other.

By openly dating this woman, Zhou Wenjing was effectively taking the opposing side to Du Xulang.

Du Xulang stared at him and saw that his nephew only nodded coldly, his attitude indifferent. He suddenly chuckled. "It’s my fault. I spoiled him too much."

If things had gone according to their original course, Du Xulang would have easily forgiven his nephew, only to be stabbed by the girl. Zhou Wenjing killed the girl’s father to avenge his uncle, and their bond actually grew closer, not more distant.

Now that Du Xulang had a lover, his desire for family ties naturally faded. Furthermore, Zhou Wenjing wasn’t even his blood relative. What did that make him? He had tricked Zhou Wenjing before, but also helped him stabilize the situation. If it weren’t for the Du family’s protection, the Zongda Group would have already been divided up.

Du Xulang felt he had already done enough for his nephew. He was no saint and wouldn’t tolerate endless indulgence. Since his nephew had shown he was ready to part ways, Du Xulang wouldn’t try to stop him.

Thinking this, Du Xulang raised his glass and drank it in one go.

Zhou Yunsheng was surprised to find that the progress bar on his smart brain had already reached 100%. After a brief moment of thought, he found the reason.

Du Xulang was Zhou Wenjing’s greatest "golden finger." The combined influence of all his women didn’t compare to Du Xulang alone. With Du Xulang’s backing, Zhou Wenjing could escape from all kinds of crises. Now that Du Xulang had withdrawn his protection, it would be much harder for him to get out of future trouble and reach his original goals.

Changing the protagonist’s fate was a shortcut to changing the world’s trajectory, but unless the protagonist was detrimental to him, Zhou Yunsheng would not actively provoke him. Zhou Wenjing’s downfall was due to him falling into the trap himself. Besides changing the protagonist’s fate, Zhou Yunsheng could also destroy the main system by changing history, technology, and even the fate of supporting characters.

He didn’t necessarily have to clash directly with the protagonist.

But undeniably, Du Xulang’s decision had saved him a lot of time and avoided many troubles. In a very good mood, Zhou Yunsheng looped his arm around Du Xulang’s neck and kissed his side cheek. "Thank you, darling. You've really helped me."

Du Xulang was momentarily stunned, then reacted quickly, pressing his hand to the back of Zhou Yunsheng’s head, exchanging a passionate kiss, and secretly slipping a ring onto his left-hand ring finger.

The guests were stunned, and several of them even gasped. The next day, rumors about the two business giants spread everywhere, but neither side’s PR teams stepped forward to clarify.
