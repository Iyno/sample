Chapter 2.1

Zhou Yunsheng had always stayed by Du Xulang's side, and on the second day after his death, he left this world without hesitation. In the past, under the control of the antagonist system, he was always on the move, completing one insane task after another, with no chance to catch his breath.

This time, however, he could freely control his time. He stayed in the starry space for a long while, nourishing his soul in a dormant state, until his feelings for Du Xulang gradually faded with the passage of time. He then woke up and began fiddling with the brain chip on his wrist.

When the brain chip hadn't been cracked, he already knew that as the difficulty of his tasks increased, his soul power was also growing stronger. At the same time, his connection with the system became increasingly tight. The system and the host depended on each other to survive, waiting for the day when the soul power reached the highest threshold. At that point, the main god would absorb and digest it through the system, becoming the energy source that supports the entire alternate dimension.

The so-called "return to the real world after completing the task" was nothing more than a beautiful lie. They were just a group of livestock raised by the main god, who would be slaughtered once they were fattened.

As the tentacles of the 007 system dug deeper into his soul, he inadvertently uncovered this secret. He was a hacker, so unlike others, he didn’t have a fervent obsession with returning to the real world. To him, reality and the virtual world were no different. In fact, he lived more freely in the virtual world. He was always the king of the virtual world.

It must be said that choosing him was the main god's biggest mistake, and it was like inviting the wolf into the house.

Adjusting his mood, Zhou Yunsheng clicked on the brain chip, and in an instant, disappeared into the endless starry sky.

When he woke up again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself standing in front of an easel, holding a paintbrush covered in paint, his body emitting a strong smell of poppy oil. He stood quietly for a moment before beginning to observe his surroundings. It was a rather empty room, without any furniture, only four white walls and an open window. Outside the window was a garden full of lush green grass and blooming flowers, and in the distance, a blue lake.

The scenery was intoxicatingly beautiful.

Aside from Zhou Yunsheng, the room was empty, and the screen of the brain chip flickered, displaying a lot of text, detailed information stolen from the main god's database about the original host and this world.

The original host's name was Wei Xiyan, 18 years old, currently studying at the Kyoto Academy of Fine Arts. When he was 10 years old, his parents died in a car accident, and he was adopted by his parents' friends, who took him to live in Country F. This couple had a deep bond, and on their silver wedding anniversary, they decided to go on a world tour, with no set return date.

Worried that Wei Xiyan wouldn’t be able to take care of himself, they entrusted him to their son, Ning Sinian, who lived in Country C.

Ning Sinian, 28 years old, had been married twice. His last wife died of bone cancer, leaving him with a son under three years old, named Ning Wangshu. Due to his busy work schedule, Ning Sinian didn’t have time to care for his son, so he hastily married a gentle and introverted woman. Though there was no emotional bond between them, their life was stable.

Wei Xiyan and Ning Sinian had only met once in childhood, and after that, Ning Sinian’s parents entrusted him with the large family business and took Wei Xiyan to live abroad for the long term. Therefore, the bond between them was not deep and was even somewhat distant.

Wei Xiyan, having lost both parents at a young age, became somewhat withdrawn, never proactively fitting in with others and never wanting to cause trouble for others. Ning Sinian, mature and steady, did not intentionally make things difficult for an orphan. They were supposed to live together in peace, not interfering with each other.

But things went wrong because Ning Sinian’s new wife, Zhao Xinfang, was a pure-looking yet venomous woman. Before marrying Ning Sinian, she had already been involved with his friend, Qian Yu. Qian Yu was a college classmate of Ning Sinian’s, and after graduating, he was invited by Ning Sinian to work as his personal assistant.

Personal assistants were mostly trusted people, which was a form of reliance and a way to train them. Once Qian Yu’s abilities met Ning Sinian’s expectations, he would naturally be given a more suitable position.

However, Qian Yu couldn’t wait. Coming from a poor background, he harbored a strong resentment toward the rich and had a pathological sense of pride. He saw being treated like a servant by Ning Sinian as an insult. He began to resent Ning Sinian, embezzling company assets and betraying the company’s interests, while also seducing Zhao Xinfang to secretly harm Ning Sinian.

But Ning Sinian, as the male lead of this world, was not so easy to deal with. Just when the two were about to succeed, the female lead appeared. Not only did she win Ning Sinian’s love, but she also exposed their conspiracy. In a series of life-threatening yet romantic confrontations, Wei Xiyan was merely an insignificant cannon fodder.

One day, he went out to buy paint and accidentally encountered Zhao Xinfang and Qian Yu sneaking out of a hotel. Fearing he would expose their affair to Ning Sinian and arouse his suspicion, they set up a poisonous plot to expel him from the Ning family.

Zhao Xinfang bribed the Ning family's maid, Wang Ma, to abuse Ning Wangshu and then secretly showed Ning Sinian the horrific scars on Ning Wangshu’s body, claiming that Wei Xiyan had beaten him while she was away. Ning Wangshu, barely two years old, had no clear sense of right and wrong. After being beaten and threatened by Wang Ma, when brought before Ning Sinian, he was terrified and kept repeating, "Uncle hit me."

After several rounds of abuse, Ning Wangshu developed autism and no longer cried or smiled. Ning Sinian naturally hated Wei Xiyan, expelling him from the house and even publicly severing ties. Zhao Xinfang’s plot served a double purpose: it removed the obstacle for her future child and kept her affair with her lover a secret.

Years later, Wang Ma retired, and the female lead came to apply as a maid. Under her gentle care, Ning Wangshu’s autism miraculously improved, and the female lead also exposed the conspiracy between Zhao Xinfang and Qian Yu. When Ning Sinian later sought out Wei Xiyan, he found that, after being abandoned by his family again, Wei Xiyan had committed suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.

Ning Sinian was deeply sorrowful and filled with guilt, and it took a lot of comfort from the female lead to get him back on his feet…

Wei Xiyan was the most innocent person in this story. He had never suspected Zhao Xinfang or Qian Yu, nor had he ever intended to tell Ning Sinian anything. Until his death, he never understood why he was expelled from the Ning family.

This character lived a very suffocating life, a hundred times worse than his predecessor. He was just a prop to enhance the relationship between the male and female leads.

After reading the information, Zhou Yunsheng tugged at his hair and sighed silently. So far, Wang Ma had already reported Wei Xiyan to Ning Sinian twice, with each report about the abuse of Ning Wangshu becoming more severe. Ning Sinian had planned to talk to Wei Xiyan, but Wei Xiyan, with his reclusive personality, would lock himself in the studio and refuse to come out whenever Ning Sinian tried to approach. This frustrated Ning Sinian, who could only instruct Wang Ma to keep a closer watch. Wang Ma, the real culprit, would never stop unless she thoroughly angered Ning Sinian.

When Wang Ma reported the abuse again, Wei Xiyan would be expelled from the house.

After the last transmigration, Zhou Yunsheng gradually figured out some tricks. To completely change the course of the world, one could alter the protagonist's fate, the original body's fate, other supporting characters, the historical process, or major events. However, the quickest way was still to change the protagonist's fate, followed by the original body's fate, and lastly the others. The further down the list, the more time and effort it would take.

As the villain, Zhou Yunsheng had fought the protagonist for several hundred to almost a thousand rounds, with a combined time that spanned at least tens of thousands of years. After breaking free from the system's control, he decided—unless the protagonist actively provoked him, he would never entangle with the protagonist again. It didn't matter if the progress was slow or the time was longer—after all, he no longer needed to race against the clock to complete tasks.

So, his best choice now was to change the original body's fate, and there was a lot of knowledge hidden within that. Helping the original body avoid danger was just the basic approach. Restoring the original body's reputation, fulfilling their unachieved wishes, and helping them achieve their dreams was the real way to make a thorough change.

Although Zhou Yunsheng could directly approach Ning Sian and explain everything, who would he believe? Wang Ma, who had served the Ning family for decades and personally raised him? Or a younger brother who had been with him for less than a year and was mentally unstable? The result was obvious.

Moreover, how could he explain that a boy with autism knew so much about the inner workings?

Zhou Yunsheng pondered for a long time and decided to use a more tactful yet more direct method to resolve the crisis. He put down his paintbrush, covered the canvas with a white cloth, and went back to the room to wash up.

In the mirror, a pale, emaciated yet handsome face appeared, with an ambiguous androgynous look typical of a young person. His light brown hair was soft and smooth, falling neatly at his ears, making people instinctively want to touch and caress it. His eyes, once sharp and bright, suddenly became dull and melancholic when they met the mirror.

After adjusting his temperament to match the original body’s exactly, Zhou Yunsheng took off his clothes and stepped into the shower. Due to the many life-threatening secrets he had uncovered on the internet, Zhou Yunsheng had long been accustomed to living a life of hiding and evading. He would hack into someone's identity, then disguise himself as that person, living their life for a while before changing to another, and so on. From appearance to personality, from temperament to habits, he could completely become someone else inside and out, and his flawless disguise earned him the fitting codename—"Impersonator."

As for the term "deicide" (god-killer), it was just a product of his phase of youthful rebellion.

Since he had taken over the original body, he would live entirely in the original body’s way, avoiding all dangers for them and fulfilling all their wishes. Now, he was the same as the original, Wei Xiyan, who had closed himself off after losing his parents.

After finishing his shower and changing into clean clothes, Ning Sian returned. Wang Ma had sent a maid upstairs to call Wei Xiyan for dinner.

As the male lead, Ning Sian was naturally extraordinarily handsome. His nearly 190 cm tall frame made him look good in whatever he wore. At that moment, he was sitting at the dining table, gently coaxing the silent and emotionless Ning Wangshu in his arms. Upon hearing footsteps, he furrowed his thick brows and cast a cold, disdainful glance over, his gaze carrying a deadly force.

The original Wei Xiyan had refused to communicate with him because he was terrified of that kind of gaze, losing his chance to explain himself. Zhou Yunsheng, however, was not afraid. But, as if startled, he shrank his neck and sat down in the farthest corner from him.

Zhao Xinfang softly said, "Sian, give me the baby. I'll feed him, you eat first." As she spoke, she carefully took Ning Wangshu into her arms, her lowered eyelids hiding the malice deep in her eyes.



==================================================
chapter2-2

Ning Wangshu had intended to tug at his father's sleeve, but upon catching the venomous glare from Wang Ma, he shuddered, then stiffened and allowed Zhao Xinfang to carry him away.

"Ah, open your mouth. This is the baby's favorite purple sweet potato rice porridge, so sweet and fragrant," Zhao Xinfang coaxed softly, her tone gentle and patient. Had it not been for Zhou Yunsheng already knowing her true nature, he might have almost been deceived by her.

Ning Sian had met Zhao Xinfang at an orphanage, where she volunteered to care for the children every weekend. Ning Sian had witnessed firsthand her tender, caring, and patient treatment of the children, which led him to consider marrying her. At this moment, he was quite pleased with her performance, and his usually cold face softened slightly.

Zhou Yunsheng ate his rice in small bites, his gaze fixed firmly on the bowl in front of him, not straying in the slightest.

After serving the dishes and cleaning the kitchen, Wang Ma wiped her hands and smiled, "Madam, let me feed the baby. You've had a long day."

Ning Wangshu’s face turned pale with fear, but because he had been intimidated by Wang Ma before, he just bit his lip silently and cried, not daring to resist. Wang Ma feigned surprise, "Oh dear, what’s happened? Just a moment ago, everything was fine, and now he's suddenly crying? The baby hasn’t spoken, eaten, or slept these past few days, and now he's crying without a sound. It’s truly heartbreaking. How did such a good child end up like this..."

As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes, making her look even more pitiful than Ning Wangshu himself.

Ning Wangshu had become as stiff as a quail, huddling in her arms, not daring to even take a deep breath. Zhou Yunsheng could see at a glance that Ning Wangshu was terrified of Wang Ma, yet Ning Sian, who had grown up under Wang Ma’s care, remained unaware, completely blind to any signs.

Now, Zhou Yunsheng’s anger was piqued by Wang Ma’s words, and his cold, sharp gaze turned toward her. However, he restrained himself out of consideration for the child, barely holding back his emotions. He lifted his son gently, offering soft words of comfort and singing the lullaby that Wang Ma used to sing to him as a child. But instead of calming Ning Wangshu, the song only caused him to tremble.

With his heart in turmoil, Ning Sian hurriedly carried his son to the room, dialing the family doctor repeatedly. Wang Ma and Zhao Xinfang quickly followed them.

In the dining room, Zhou Yunsheng was left alone. He put down his bowl, wiped his mouth slowly, and washed his hands before heading to the room.

Wei Xiyan’s room was simply decorated, with a bookshelf filled with books on painting techniques. Most of the drawers were stuffed with paints and canvases from various brands. He was obviously a painting enthusiast, with nothing else in his life but his art.

But the current Zhou Yunsheng was a hacker, and he urgently needed a computer. After rummaging through the room for a while, he finally found a laptop under the bed, turned it on, and connected to the internet.

The dim light cast shadows on the delicate face, still androgynous in appearance. His expression was focused as his fingers moved across the keyboard with almost imperceptible speed. A few minutes later, his concentration was interrupted by a loud knocking on the door. He frowned in annoyance.

"Wei Xiyan, we need to talk. Come out!" Ning Sian's voice was low and firm as he knocked. When there was no response, he grew impatient and kicked the door.

Fortunately, the Ning family was wealthy, and the door was made of solid wood, well-crafted. It wouldn’t be easy to break it down without a couple of strong men.

Zhou Yunsheng relaxed his tense muscles, pursed his lips, and picked up a teacup from the desk, throwing it with force to show his resolute refusal to meet Ning Sian.

The original Wei Xiyan had feared talking to Ning Sian, but Zhou Yunsheng now simply didn’t want to talk to him. Ning Sian had already sentenced Wei Xiyan to death in his heart. No matter how much Wei Xiyan tried to explain, it was unlikely Ning Sian would listen.

Hearing the crash of the cup and seeing the tea spill onto the carpet, it was clear the person inside was on the verge of a breakdown. Thinking of his parents' repeated warning to "never provoke Xiyan," Ning Sian tugged at his tie and reluctantly stepped away. He had once photographed the bruises on his son’s body and sent them to his parents across the ocean, but no matter what, they refused to believe it, insisting that Wei Xiyan would never harm anyone.

Throwing a cup like that—was this not evidence of harm? If not him, could it have been Xinfang? Or Wang Ma? One was the gentle and kind wife, the other the caretaker who had treated him like a son. Ning Sian doubted anyone would suspect them. Besides, his son had clearly said it was his uncle who did it—at such a young age, how could he lie?

Hearing the footsteps fade, Zhou Yunsheng pressed the enter key and implanted a small program he had written into Ning Sian’s computer.

Ning Sinian sat by his son's bedside, watching the boy's restless sleep, his face still filled with fear despite the sedative. His heart twisted with pain. The family doctor's words echoed in his mind again and again:

"Mr. Ning, judging by the situation, your son has suffered psychological trauma from abuse. You need to find him a psychologist as soon as possible and keep him away from the source of his fear."

Keep him away from the source of his fear? Ning Sinian pondered for a moment, then quietly walked toward the study. In the dim hallway light, Zhao Xinfang stood waiting. Seeing him approach, she whispered, "I'm sorry, Sinian. I failed to take good care of the baby. Maybe I should quit my job at the orphanage? Wang Ma is looking after him alone, and sometimes it's just too much for her. Also, I've already contacted a psychologist—Dr. Sun Wen from the Department of Psychology at Kyoto Medical University. He specializes in children's psychological issues and is one of the top experts in the country. Here’s his card. Keep it for now. I’ll take the baby to his sessions every Wednesday."

"No need to quit. You only go on weekends; it doesn’t take up much time. Besides, a thief can hide for a thousand days, but no one can guard against them forever. I'll talk to my parents and try to get Wei Xiyan sent away as soon as possible. I was planning to reach out to Dr. Cullen, but you beat me to it. Dr. Sun Wen is a good choice, and he’s already in the country, which makes things convenient. Thank you, Xinfang." Ning Sinian took the card and examined it carefully.

Zhao Xinfang noticed how exhausted he looked. She hesitated but ultimately said nothing. The brothers barely spent any time together, and their relationship was distant. Who knew if, in the future, when they grew closer, Wei Xiyan might spill everything about that day? But for now, her plan had worked perfectly, and she had even managed to turn Ning Wangshu into an imbecile. The satisfaction bubbling in her heart was indescribable.

She quietly shut the door behind her and smiled.

Ning Sinian walked to the window, lit a cigarette, and took deep drags. The orange ember flickered rapidly, mirroring his restless mind. He finished the cigarette in less than half a minute before turning on the desk lamp and calling his parents.

"The number you dialed is turned off..."

"The number you dialed is turned off..."

"The number you dialed..."

After several failed attempts, he irritably tossed his phone aside, accidentally nudging the mouse and waking his computer from sleep mode. A pop-up ad appeared, its bright orange text catching his eye.

He was about to close it when he suddenly froze.

"Are you worried about theft in your home? Concerned about lazy housekeepers? Angry that your child is being abused by a nanny? Pinhole cameras—solving all your troubles! □□, professional installation at your doorstep, convenient and practical..."

Ning Sinian didn’t bother reading further. A sharp gleam flashed in his eyes.

If his parents refused to believe him, he would present them with undeniable proof. With solid evidence, even if Wei Xiyan refused to leave, Ning Sinian would have him thrown out—and make him pay a heavy price.

He picked up his phone again and called Zhao Jun.

Zhao Jun lived on the west side of the Ning family estate. A former mercenary, he now served as Ning Sinian’s driver and bodyguard, handling many of his more unsavory tasks. When he received the call, he didn’t ask any questions and quickly prepared a full set of surveillance equipment.

The next day, while Ning Sinian was at work, Zhao Jun pretended to clean the air conditioning vents while installing pinhole cameras throughout the Ning household—even in the bathrooms. He also placed a tiny, rice-sized listening device inside the longevity locket worn by Ning Wangshu.

It was summer vacation, so Zhou Yunsheng didn’t have school. After breakfast, he locked himself in the art studio. Now that he had taken Wei Xiyan’s place, he naturally had to fulfill Wei Xiyan’s dream.

And there was no doubt—Wei Xiyan’s dream was to become a great artist.

Sensing the presence of new surveillance devices in the house, Zhou Yunsheng’s already neutral mood brightened. He reached out his slender, fair fingers and lifted the white cloth covering the canvas.

It was a nearly finished pastoral landscape, depicting the Ning estate. Under the golden sunlight, a garden bloomed with roses and climbing vines, painted in warm tones that exuded a sense of joy. To be fair, Wei Xiyan did have some natural talent for painting. However, his narrow perspective and reclusive personality prevented him from capturing deeper emotions in his work.

His paintings were delicate and beautiful, offering visual enjoyment, but they failed to touch the soul.

Zhou Yunsheng had experienced hundreds, if not thousands, of lifetimes. Although he had always played the villain, one undeniable fact remained—without a certain level of skill, how could he ever stand against the protagonist?

In every reincarnation, while fulfilling his assigned role, he had also honed a variety of talents. He had been a scholar, a grand advisor, an emperor, a cultivator. He had also been a knight, a duke, a pope, a sorcerer. These experiences had brought him immeasurable suffering but also granted him invaluable knowledge.

His repertoire of skills was vast and eclectic, and of course, painting was among them. Whether it was traditional Chinese painting, oil painting, sketching, or watercolor—give him a brush, and he could create an entire world.

His mastery of painting was far beyond Wei Xiyan’s. In fact, in this entire world, there wasn’t a single person who could compare to him.

Fulfilling Wei Xiyan’s dream was effortless for Zhou Yunsheng.

He leisurely studied Wei Xiyan’s artwork, analyzing his painting techniques. The room was silent except for the rustling of leaves in the breeze.

At that moment, a small figure stepped inside.

The child stood hesitantly at the door, seemingly captivated by the scene on the canvas. Step by step, he cautiously made his way over, his movements light as a feather.

Just as Zhou Yunsheng finished analyzing Wei Xiyan’s style and turned to grab his brush and palette, he found himself locking eyes with Ning Wangshu.

Both of them were naturally reserved, so they startled each other. They stared, wide-eyed and motionless, exchanging a silent gaze.

After a long pause, Zhou Yunsheng slowly—very slowly—reached out his hand, picking up the palette from a stool beside Ning Wangshu.

Ning Wangshu had been planning to step back, but seeing that he wasn’t the target of the movement, he stopped and tilted his head up to watch.

Zhou Yunsheng paid him no mind. He diluted the paint and started applying strokes to the canvas.

Uncle and nephew stood side by side—one painting, the other watching intently. Their similarly delicate features bore the same blank expressions.

The scene was somewhat amusing, yet at the same time, incredibly heartwarming and endearing.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 2.3
When Ning Wangshu met Zhou Yunsheng’s gaze, his entire body tensed up, ready to flee on his short little legs at any moment. However, Zhou Yunsheng carefully avoided him, merely picking up the palette and paintbrush beside him before turning to his canvas without any further actions.

Ning Wangshu secretly let out a breath of relief and shuffled closer, step by step, tilting his small head up to watch the painting with sparkling eyes.

Zhou Yunsheng, entirely absorbed in his work, had long stopped noticing the tiny figure at his feet. He had inherited Wei Xiyan’s passion for painting completely, his brush never pausing as it glided over the canvas.

Wei Xiyan excelled in modern direct painting, sketching outlines on the canvas before slowly adding color. However, Zhou Yunsheng specialized in an even older technique—glazing—where layers of paint, thinned with oil but without added white, were meticulously applied. Each layer had to dry completely before the next was added, meaning that before he even began, the entire painting had already taken shape in his mind.

Because each layer of paint was thin, the colors underneath subtly shone through, blending with the upper layers to create delicate tonal variations. This method required exceptional skill and precise control over color harmonization.

Wei Xiyan’s painting featured large areas of warm tones, which had already dried. Zhou Yunsheng now added layers of blue, purple, and green on top, gradually transforming the warmth into a cooler palette. Finally, he glazed the surface with resin varnish, creating a layered interplay of grays.

In just half an hour, a once vibrant garden bursting with spring blossoms had turned into a starlit forest. The sky shimmered with countless twinkling stars, their faint glow so lifelike it seemed one could pluck them straight from the canvas. The painting did not merely resemble a piece of art—it looked like a gateway to another world, breathtakingly real yet hauntingly surreal.

Zhou Yunsheng took a few steps back to examine his work when a soft gasp of amazement reached his ears. Only then did he snap out of his artistic trance and lower his gaze to the little one standing at his feet.

Day had turned to night, sunlight to starlight, a garden to a forest. Even though Ning Wangshu was too young to understand aesthetics, he was still completely awed by his uncle’s extraordinary skill.

Realizing that he had disturbed his uncle, Ning Wangshu hurriedly clapped his chubby hands over his mouth, his wide eyes filled with panic.

But Zhou Yunsheng merely cast him a brief glance before turning back to scrutinize his painting, picking up the brush for minor adjustments.

Ning Wangshu let out another sigh of relief. Seeing that his uncle had no intention of driving him away, his courage gradually grew. He reached out toward the brushes resting on the stool—stretching out, pulling back, stretching out, pulling back. After much hesitation, he finally grasped one in his tiny hands.

A bucket of cleaning oil sat on the floor beside a few white cloths. Quick as a flash, Ning Wangshu dipped his brush into a bit of poppy oil and crouched down, smearing it across the white cloth. He tried to paint a few stars, but when he realized they weren’t as dazzling as his uncle’s, he scowled and turned them into suns instead…

Completely engrossed in his play, he failed to notice that Zhou Yunsheng had finished his final touches and was now bending over, watching him intently.

“You can’t play with this.”

The teenager’s voice was as gentle as a murmuring brook, yet the force with which he took the brush from Ning Wangshu’s hands left no room for argument.

The little boy was stunned. His rosy face instantly turned pale, and like a frightened quail, he shrank into the corner.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t comfort him. He simply placed the brush and oil bucket on the windowsill, making sure they were out of reach before walking out of the studio.

Ning Wangshu covered his face, tears pattering down onto the white cloth, soaking it in large patches. He looked utterly pitiful.

But not long after, the teenager returned, holding a box of watercolor pens and a stack of white paper. He crouched down, handing them over as he spoke slowly and clearly, “Use these instead. Paint and poppy oil contain trace amounts of toxins. Babies shouldn’t touch them—you’ll get sick.”

Ning Wangshu kept crying and refused to look up. Seeing this, Zhou Yunsheng didn’t press further. He simply set down the supplies and turned back to his work. He wasn’t the talkative type to begin with, so saying this much was already a miracle.

So Uncle wasn’t annoyed with him after all.

The weight in Ning Wangshu’s little heart suddenly lifted. He rubbed his eyes hard before sneaking a glance up. Just as he reached out to grab the watercolor pens, his uncle abruptly turned toward him. Startled, he immediately curled up into a ball, hugging his head like a tiny turtle.

Zhou Yunsheng was almost amused by the little one’s reaction, but with surveillance cameras covering the entire studio, he had to restrain himself. He took several deep breaths, maintaining a serious expression as he removed a white shirt hanging on the easel.

He helped the child put it on, his voice low, “Wear this properly so you don’t dirty your clothes.”

Ning Wangshu stopped struggling and obediently let his uncle dress him. The shirt was oversized—its sleeves had to be rolled up multiple times just to reveal his plump little hands, and the hem draped so long it completely covered his pants.

Zhou Yunsheng straightened the collar, then, somewhat awkwardly, ruffled the little one’s head before turning back to his painting.

Ning Wangshu also touched his own forehead, savoring the lingering warmth. His heart felt sweet and light. He didn’t smile, but his eyes had never shone so brightly. Gripping the watercolor pen, he began to doodle, imitating his uncle’s masterpiece.

The studio fell into a serene stillness, so quiet that even the sound of a pin drop could be heard. Side by side, the uncle and nephew painted together, their harmonious presence filling the space with a warmth that melted the heart.

Time slipped away unnoticed. It wasn’t until four or five in the afternoon that Wang Ma finally strolled into the house, carrying a vegetable basket.

There was another maid in the household, so she wasn’t needed to watch over the child at all times. Besides, at her age, she had little patience for babysitting. Every day, as soon as Ning Sinian left the house, she would grab her basket under the pretense of grocery shopping—only to sneak off to the nearby park for a game of cards with the other housemaids.

Having once been discreet about her laziness in front of Zhao Xinfang, she now acted with increasing brazenness after benefiting from her generosity. Zhao Xinfang, contrary to what Ning Sinian had assumed, was not simply staying home to care for her stepson whenever she wasn’t volunteering. She, too, was frequently out and about—shopping, playing cards, or indulging in beauty treatments.

Since Ning Sinian was always busy and seldom home, returning late even when he did, she—just like Wang Ma—only needed to ensure she was back before six in the evening.

Today was Sunday. Using the orphanage as an excuse, she planned to return even later.

Wang Ma inquired with the maids and, upon learning that Zhao Xinfang had not yet come home, went upstairs to find Ning Wangshu.

In the art studio, the moment Ning Wangshu heard Wang Ma’s voice calling out, his face turned deathly pale, and his small body trembled uncontrollably.

Zhou Yunsheng gently patted his little head in reassurance before helping him remove his shirt and wash his hands.

The old Wei Xiyan had noticed something amiss with Ning Wangshu before. He had once mustered the courage to inquire after hearing the child’s heart-wrenching cries.

But Wang Ma had dismissed it with a simple explanation: the boy was suffering from tooth decay, and the pain made him cry.

Though Wei Xiyan remained suspicious, he hesitated for a long time before finally managing to squeeze out an embarrassed “Really?” under Wang Ma’s sharp glare, ultimately retreating in defeat.

As soon as he left, Wang Ma shut the door and continued beating Ning Wangshu, not treating him as anything more than an inconvenience.

Now, however, Zhou Yunsheng didn’t regard Wang Ma with any significance either. He gently cradled the little boy, patiently soothing him.

When Wang Ma finally found them and demanded that the child be handed over, he not only refused but slammed the door in her face, nearly causing her to bump her nose.

“You wretched little bastard! Who do you think you are? One day, Sinian will throw you out!” she spat venomously at the closed door.

Zhou Yunsheng paid no heed to the curses outside. After setting the child down, he continued painting.

Only his little uncle could see his fear and despair. Only his little uncle would not hand him over to Wang Ma. Only his little uncle would protect him so resolutely.

Though it was merely a door being shut, it felt like a barrier shielding him from all dangers.

At just three years old, Ning Wangshu had already developed a sense of self. At this moment, he felt an unshakable attachment to Zhou Yunsheng. At the same time, he vaguely understood that the words he had spoken to his father might bring trouble to his little uncle.

A mix of joy and sorrow swelled in his heart as he carefully wrapped his arms around his little uncle’s leg.

Zhou Yunsheng nudged him disdainfully, but his touch was feather-light.

For once, Ning Wangshu did not cower. Instead, he clung on persistently.

Try as he might, Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t shake off this little tail of his. In the end, he could only resign himself to the embrace.

If he moved left, the little one would stumble after him; if he moved right, the child would totter in pursuit, sticking to him like an unshakable shadow—a sight so ridiculous it was almost comical.

While the uncle and nephew played happily, Wang Ma was relieved to not have to deal with them. She hurried the maids to prepare her meal.

But before five-thirty, the sound of an engine roaring outside startled her—Ning Sinian was back early.

Panic surged through Wang Ma at the thought of the harmonious scene in the art studio. She rushed upstairs and whispered urgently, “Wei Xiyan, hurry and bring the child out! If Mr. Ning sees you with him, he’ll throw you out for sure!”

The old Wei Xiyan, wary of Ning Sinian’s growing coldness and disdain, had indeed been afraid to get too close to Ning Wangshu.

Zhou Yunsheng, however, knowing the truth, had no intention of exposing Wang Ma’s little charade. Calmly, he opened the door and led the frightened boy out.

Ning Wangshu felt his little forehead being rubbed. The warmth eased his fear. He also understood that as long as his father was home, Wang Ma wouldn’t dare to hurt him. Steeling himself, he took stiff, hesitant steps forward.

Wang Ma wasted no time in yanking him to her side, half-dragging him downstairs without caring if he could keep up. She hissed in a low voice, “You are never to be with Wei Xiyan again, or I’ll skin you alive!”

“Little Uncle is not a bastard.”

For the first time in a long while, Ning Wangshu spoke—his voice strikingly clear.

Wang Ma froze for a moment, then her face twisted with rage. She reached out and viciously twisted his ear.

The little boy hunched his shoulders and curled inward, enduring in silence.

Fortunately, Ning Sinian had already started upstairs in his haste to see his son. Wang Ma quickly let go, scooping the child into her arms.

With a bright smile plastered on her face, she leaned close and whispered through gritted teeth, “Not only is Wei Xiyan a bastard, but so are you. If you don’t obey me, I’ll throw you into the river and drown you. Your father has a new wife, and soon, he’ll have many new children. He won’t care about you at all.”

Terror consumed Ning Wangshu. His tiny hands clenched into fists, his eyes squeezing shut as tears streamed silently down his face.

Chapter 2.4
Early in the morning, Ning Sinian drove out alone—not to the company, but to the nearest underground parking lot, where he hid, put on his headphones, and eavesdropped on the sounds from home. Zhao Jun remained in the west wing, keeping an eye on the surveillance monitors. If Wei Xiyan showed the slightest hint of hostility toward Ning Wangshu, he would rush over to intervene, sending the footage straight to Ning’s parents overseas.

Ning Sinian was tense the moment he put on the headphones. The image of his son’s terrified expression was still etched into his mind, impossible to dispel. He feared even the slightest harm befalling him, his entire focus locked onto the headset, ready to step on the gas and race home at the first sign of trouble.

The listening device was hidden within the hollowed-out pendant of a longevity locket, delivering crystal-clear audio. He heard the housekeeper, Wang Ma, sternly warning his son not to run around. The child remained silent, followed by a long stretch of silence.

Ning Sinian sat in the same position, gripping the steering wheel from morning until early afternoon, shifting from nervous anticipation to numbness. Just as he was about to succumb to the stillness, a voice as clear and crisp as a mountain spring rang out:

“No, you can’t play with that.”

It was Wei Xiyan’s signature flat tone. Ning Sinian immediately sat up straight, holding his breath, straining to discern any underlying emotion in his voice. Yet, surprisingly, there was none—no malice, no hostility. His sharp instincts told him as much, but still, he placed his hand on the ignition, prepared to start the engine.

Before he could press down, that same clear voice sounded again. The tone remained flat, but the concern embedded in each syllable was unmistakable.

“If you use this to paint, the pigments and poppy oil contain trace toxins. Little ones shouldn’t touch them—it’ll make you sick.”

So, he was merely stopping his son from playing with oil paints. A perfectly reasonable action.

Ning Sinian exhaled deeply, retracting his hand from the ignition, resting his weary forehead against the steering wheel.

Another silence followed. When Wei Xiyan spoke again, Ning Sinian had already trained himself to remain calm.

“Put this on properly, so you don’t get your clothes dirty.”

He was helping the child put on a smock to protect his clothes—another perfectly reasonable act. Ning Sinian frowned, struggling to reconcile this gentle, attentive youth with the violent, volatile figure Wang Ma had described.

Had they misjudged the situation? Or was the boy simply adept at deception? But no matter how well he feigned kindness, wouldn’t the victim instinctively know to stay away from him?

Yet, through the headset, he could hear his son’s light, eager footsteps—clearly, it was the child himself who had wandered into the studio.

Ning Sinian removed his headphones, raking a hand through his hair, finally making up his mind—he had to return home at once.

The moment his car pulled into the driveway, Zhao Jun emerged from the west wing, lowering his voice.

“Boss, you’d better check the surveillance footage yourself. Maybe we’ve been wrong all along.”

Ning Sinian nodded and strode past him, heading upstairs. At the landing, he nearly bumped into Wang Ma, who was carrying his son.

The child’s face was as pale as a sheet, his large eyes brimming with unshed tears, his expression fraught with terror. Yet, through the headset, he had barely made a sound all day. The quiet rustling of a paintbrush against paper had been the only sign of his presence, conveying a sense of peace—even contentment.

Why had everything changed the moment he returned?

Suspicion coiled tighter in Ning Sinian’s chest. Taking his son from Wang Ma’s arms, he was startled to find the boy resisting his touch, his tear-filled gaze filled with resentment.

A sharp, piercing ache lanced through Ning Sinian’s heart. More than ever, he needed to know what had truly transpired in this seemingly uneventful day.

“Wang Ma, take him to the garden to see the ducklings. I’ll join you after I change.”

Handing the child back, he turned and strode toward his study.

He opened his computer without hesitation, pulling up the day’s surveillance footage. The hidden cameras followed Ning Wangshu’s movements, shifting angles as he moved.

Wang Ma had gone out early to buy groceries, leaving the child alone in the living room, sitting motionless on the carpet, playing with his toys without the slightest change in expression—like an empty shell devoid of a soul.

He remained there until noon when a maid entered with lunch, placing the tray down before leaving without so much as a word of encouragement. She didn’t even attempt to coax him into eating.

Yet, the boy was well-behaved, nibbling at a piece of cake, taking small sips of milk, before slowly making his way toward the studio.

Ning Sinian’s dark brows furrowed. If Wei Xiyan had truly been abusing his son, why would the child seek him out on his own?

Suppressing his growing unease, he continued watching.

At the studio door, the little boy peeked inside, hesitating for a long moment. Seeing that Wei Xiyan was wholly absorbed in his painting, he finally took tentative steps forward.

As the teenager turned to fetch a brush, their gazes met.

Ning Sinian tensed instinctively, his fists clenching, fearing that the boy might lash out in a fit of violence. But nothing happened. Wei Xiyan merely shifted to avoid the child and continued painting.

The terror in the boy’s eyes dissipated almost instantly, replaced by an awed expression.

The light that rekindled in those dark, lifeless eyes nearly brought tears to Ning Sinian’s own.

Then came the moment he had overheard—Wei Xiyan stopping the child from playing with the paints, helping him put on a smock, gently tousling his hair with a quiet tenderness.

As the boy reached up to touch his forehead where those fingers had just been, his wide eyes shimmered with unspoken attachment.

Who would ever long for the touch of someone who had beaten them?

A sharp pang tightened Ning Sinian’s chest. Stifling his rising anxiety, he kept watching.

A tall and a small figure stood side by side, each with their own easel. Wei Xiyan’s canvas shimmered with starlight, while the boy’s was a dark, chaotic mess of colors—its subject unidentifiable. But he was happy, tugging at the teenager’s sleeve, eager for his approval.

Wei Xiyan didn’t speak but ruffled his hair in silent praise. The boy’s eyes lit up with uncontainable joy.

Unaware of himself, Ning Sinian had begun to smile—a soft, unconscious curve of the lips. The sharpness in his gaze had long since melted into something far gentler. As he watched the two figures on the screen, for the first time in what felt like forever, the world seemed peaceful.

But the moment was shattered by Wang Ma’s sudden shouting.

The child flinched violently, his face draining of color. His earlier warmth and vitality vanished, replaced by the all-too-familiar look of sheer terror.

Wang Ma appeared at the doorway, calling the boy over.

Wei Xiyan moved first, stepping forward and slamming the door shut with force.

Miraculously, Ning Wangshu stopped trembling. Instead, he clung to Wei Xiyan’s leg, his small face filled with reverence and unwavering trust—as though the boy standing before him was his hero.
