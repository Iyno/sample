Chapter 2.1

Zhou Yunsheng had always stayed by Du Xulang's side, and on the second day after his death, he left this world without hesitation. In the past, under the control of the antagonist system, he was always on the move, completing one insane task after another, with no chance to catch his breath.

This time, however, he could freely control his time. He stayed in the starry space for a long while, nourishing his soul in a dormant state, until his feelings for Du Xulang gradually faded with the passage of time. He then woke up and began fiddling with the brain chip on his wrist.

When the brain chip hadn't been cracked, he already knew that as the difficulty of his tasks increased, his soul power was also growing stronger. At the same time, his connection with the system became increasingly tight. The system and the host depended on each other to survive, waiting for the day when the soul power reached the highest threshold. At that point, the main god would absorb and digest it through the system, becoming the energy source that supports the entire alternate dimension.

The so-called "return to the real world after completing the task" was nothing more than a beautiful lie. They were just a group of livestock raised by the main god, who would be slaughtered once they were fattened.

As the tentacles of the 007 system dug deeper into his soul, he inadvertently uncovered this secret. He was a hacker, so unlike others, he didn’t have a fervent obsession with returning to the real world. To him, reality and the virtual world were no different. In fact, he lived more freely in the virtual world. He was always the king of the virtual world.

It must be said that choosing him was the main god's biggest mistake, and it was like inviting the wolf into the house.

Adjusting his mood, Zhou Yunsheng clicked on the brain chip, and in an instant, disappeared into the endless starry sky.

When he woke up again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself standing in front of an easel, holding a paintbrush covered in paint, his body emitting a strong smell of poppy oil. He stood quietly for a moment before beginning to observe his surroundings. It was a rather empty room, without any furniture, only four white walls and an open window. Outside the window was a garden full of lush green grass and blooming flowers, and in the distance, a blue lake.

The scenery was intoxicatingly beautiful.

Aside from Zhou Yunsheng, the room was empty, and the screen of the brain chip flickered, displaying a lot of text, detailed information stolen from the main god's database about the original host and this world.

The original host's name was Wei Xiyan, 18 years old, currently studying at the Kyoto Academy of Fine Arts. When he was 10 years old, his parents died in a car accident, and he was adopted by his parents' friends, who took him to live in Country F. This couple had a deep bond, and on their silver wedding anniversary, they decided to go on a world tour, with no set return date.

Worried that Wei Xiyan wouldn’t be able to take care of himself, they entrusted him to their son, Ning Sinian, who lived in Country C.

Ning Sinian, 28 years old, had been married twice. His last wife died of bone cancer, leaving him with a son under three years old, named Ning Wangshu. Due to his busy work schedule, Ning Sinian didn’t have time to care for his son, so he hastily married a gentle and introverted woman. Though there was no emotional bond between them, their life was stable.

Wei Xiyan and Ning Sinian had only met once in childhood, and after that, Ning Sinian’s parents entrusted him with the large family business and took Wei Xiyan to live abroad for the long term. Therefore, the bond between them was not deep and was even somewhat distant.

Wei Xiyan, having lost both parents at a young age, became somewhat withdrawn, never proactively fitting in with others and never wanting to cause trouble for others. Ning Sinian, mature and steady, did not intentionally make things difficult for an orphan. They were supposed to live together in peace, not interfering with each other.

But things went wrong because Ning Sinian’s new wife, Zhao Xinfang, was a pure-looking yet venomous woman. Before marrying Ning Sinian, she had already been involved with his friend, Qian Yu. Qian Yu was a college classmate of Ning Sinian’s, and after graduating, he was invited by Ning Sinian to work as his personal assistant.

Personal assistants were mostly trusted people, which was a form of reliance and a way to train them. Once Qian Yu’s abilities met Ning Sinian’s expectations, he would naturally be given a more suitable position.

However, Qian Yu couldn’t wait. Coming from a poor background, he harbored a strong resentment toward the rich and had a pathological sense of pride. He saw being treated like a servant by Ning Sinian as an insult. He began to resent Ning Sinian, embezzling company assets and betraying the company’s interests, while also seducing Zhao Xinfang to secretly harm Ning Sinian.

But Ning Sinian, as the male lead of this world, was not so easy to deal with. Just when the two were about to succeed, the female lead appeared. Not only did she win Ning Sinian’s love, but she also exposed their conspiracy. In a series of life-threatening yet romantic confrontations, Wei Xiyan was merely an insignificant cannon fodder.

One day, he went out to buy paint and accidentally encountered Zhao Xinfang and Qian Yu sneaking out of a hotel. Fearing he would expose their affair to Ning Sinian and arouse his suspicion, they set up a poisonous plot to expel him from the Ning family.

Zhao Xinfang bribed the Ning family's maid, Wang Ma, to abuse Ning Wangshu and then secretly showed Ning Sinian the horrific scars on Ning Wangshu’s body, claiming that Wei Xiyan had beaten him while she was away. Ning Wangshu, barely two years old, had no clear sense of right and wrong. After being beaten and threatened by Wang Ma, when brought before Ning Sinian, he was terrified and kept repeating, "Uncle hit me."

After several rounds of abuse, Ning Wangshu developed autism and no longer cried or smiled. Ning Sinian naturally hated Wei Xiyan, expelling him from the house and even publicly severing ties. Zhao Xinfang’s plot served a double purpose: it removed the obstacle for her future child and kept her affair with her lover a secret.

Years later, Wang Ma retired, and the female lead came to apply as a maid. Under her gentle care, Ning Wangshu’s autism miraculously improved, and the female lead also exposed the conspiracy between Zhao Xinfang and Qian Yu. When Ning Sinian later sought out Wei Xiyan, he found that, after being abandoned by his family again, Wei Xiyan had committed suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.

Ning Sinian was deeply sorrowful and filled with guilt, and it took a lot of comfort from the female lead to get him back on his feet…

Wei Xiyan was the most innocent person in this story. He had never suspected Zhao Xinfang or Qian Yu, nor had he ever intended to tell Ning Sinian anything. Until his death, he never understood why he was expelled from the Ning family.

This character lived a very suffocating life, a hundred times worse than his predecessor. He was just a prop to enhance the relationship between the male and female leads.

After reading the information, Zhou Yunsheng tugged at his hair and sighed silently. So far, Wang Ma had already reported Wei Xiyan to Ning Sinian twice, with each report about the abuse of Ning Wangshu becoming more severe. Ning Sinian had planned to talk to Wei Xiyan, but Wei Xiyan, with his reclusive personality, would lock himself in the studio and refuse to come out whenever Ning Sinian tried to approach. This frustrated Ning Sinian, who could only instruct Wang Ma to keep a closer watch. Wang Ma, the real culprit, would never stop unless she thoroughly angered Ning Sinian.

When Wang Ma reported the abuse again, Wei Xiyan would be expelled from the house.

After the last transmigration, Zhou Yunsheng gradually figured out some tricks. To completely change the course of the world, one could alter the protagonist's fate, the original body's fate, other supporting characters, the historical process, or major events. However, the quickest way was still to change the protagonist's fate, followed by the original body's fate, and lastly the others. The further down the list, the more time and effort it would take.

As the villain, Zhou Yunsheng had fought the protagonist for several hundred to almost a thousand rounds, with a combined time that spanned at least tens of thousands of years. After breaking free from the system's control, he decided—unless the protagonist actively provoked him, he would never entangle with the protagonist again. It didn't matter if the progress was slow or the time was longer—after all, he no longer needed to race against the clock to complete tasks.

So, his best choice now was to change the original body's fate, and there was a lot of knowledge hidden within that. Helping the original body avoid danger was just the basic approach. Restoring the original body's reputation, fulfilling their unachieved wishes, and helping them achieve their dreams was the real way to make a thorough change.

Although Zhou Yunsheng could directly approach Ning Sian and explain everything, who would he believe? Wang Ma, who had served the Ning family for decades and personally raised him? Or a younger brother who had been with him for less than a year and was mentally unstable? The result was obvious.

Moreover, how could he explain that a boy with autism knew so much about the inner workings?

Zhou Yunsheng pondered for a long time and decided to use a more tactful yet more direct method to resolve the crisis. He put down his paintbrush, covered the canvas with a white cloth, and went back to the room to wash up.

In the mirror, a pale, emaciated yet handsome face appeared, with an ambiguous androgynous look typical of a young person. His light brown hair was soft and smooth, falling neatly at his ears, making people instinctively want to touch and caress it. His eyes, once sharp and bright, suddenly became dull and melancholic when they met the mirror.

After adjusting his temperament to match the original body’s exactly, Zhou Yunsheng took off his clothes and stepped into the shower. Due to the many life-threatening secrets he had uncovered on the internet, Zhou Yunsheng had long been accustomed to living a life of hiding and evading. He would hack into someone's identity, then disguise himself as that person, living their life for a while before changing to another, and so on. From appearance to personality, from temperament to habits, he could completely become someone else inside and out, and his flawless disguise earned him the fitting codename—"Impersonator."

As for the term "deicide" (god-killer), it was just a product of his phase of youthful rebellion.

Since he had taken over the original body, he would live entirely in the original body’s way, avoiding all dangers for them and fulfilling all their wishes. Now, he was the same as the original, Wei Xiyan, who had closed himself off after losing his parents.

After finishing his shower and changing into clean clothes, Ning Sian returned. Wang Ma had sent a maid upstairs to call Wei Xiyan for dinner.

As the male lead, Ning Sian was naturally extraordinarily handsome. His nearly 190 cm tall frame made him look good in whatever he wore. At that moment, he was sitting at the dining table, gently coaxing the silent and emotionless Ning Wangshu in his arms. Upon hearing footsteps, he furrowed his thick brows and cast a cold, disdainful glance over, his gaze carrying a deadly force.

The original Wei Xiyan had refused to communicate with him because he was terrified of that kind of gaze, losing his chance to explain himself. Zhou Yunsheng, however, was not afraid. But, as if startled, he shrank his neck and sat down in the farthest corner from him.

Zhao Xinfang softly said, "Sian, give me the baby. I'll feed him, you eat first." As she spoke, she carefully took Ning Wangshu into her arms, her lowered eyelids hiding the malice deep in her eyes.
