Chapter 2.1

Zhou Yunsheng had always stayed by Du Xulang's side, and on the second day after his death, he left this world without hesitation. In the past, under the control of the antagonist system, he was always on the move, completing one insane task after another, with no chance to catch his breath.

This time, however, he could freely control his time. He stayed in the starry space for a long while, nourishing his soul in a dormant state, until his feelings for Du Xulang gradually faded with the passage of time. He then woke up and began fiddling with the brain chip on his wrist.

When the brain chip hadn't been cracked, he already knew that as the difficulty of his tasks increased, his soul power was also growing stronger. At the same time, his connection with the system became increasingly tight. The system and the host depended on each other to survive, waiting for the day when the soul power reached the highest threshold. At that point, the main god would absorb and digest it through the system, becoming the energy source that supports the entire alternate dimension.

The so-called "return to the real world after completing the task" was nothing more than a beautiful lie. They were just a group of livestock raised by the main god, who would be slaughtered once they were fattened.

As the tentacles of the 007 system dug deeper into his soul, he inadvertently uncovered this secret. He was a hacker, so unlike others, he didn’t have a fervent obsession with returning to the real world. To him, reality and the virtual world were no different. In fact, he lived more freely in the virtual world. He was always the king of the virtual world.

It must be said that choosing him was the main god's biggest mistake, and it was like inviting the wolf into the house.

Adjusting his mood, Zhou Yunsheng clicked on the brain chip, and in an instant, disappeared into the endless starry sky.

When he woke up again, Zhou Yunsheng found himself standing in front of an easel, holding a paintbrush covered in paint, his body emitting a strong smell of poppy oil. He stood quietly for a moment before beginning to observe his surroundings. It was a rather empty room, without any furniture, only four white walls and an open window. Outside the window was a garden full of lush green grass and blooming flowers, and in the distance, a blue lake.

The scenery was intoxicatingly beautiful.

Aside from Zhou Yunsheng, the room was empty, and the screen of the brain chip flickered, displaying a lot of text, detailed information stolen from the main god's database about the original host and this world.

The original host's name was Wei Xiyan, 18 years old, currently studying at the Kyoto Academy of Fine Arts. When he was 10 years old, his parents died in a car accident, and he was adopted by his parents' friends, who took him to live in Country F. This couple had a deep bond, and on their silver wedding anniversary, they decided to go on a world tour, with no set return date.

Worried that Wei Xiyan wouldn’t be able to take care of himself, they entrusted him to their son, Ning Sinian, who lived in Country C.

Ning Sinian, 28 years old, had been married twice. His last wife died of bone cancer, leaving him with a son under three years old, named Ning Wangshu. Due to his busy work schedule, Ning Sinian didn’t have time to care for his son, so he hastily married a gentle and introverted woman. Though there was no emotional bond between them, their life was stable.

Wei Xiyan and Ning Sinian had only met once in childhood, and after that, Ning Sinian’s parents entrusted him with the large family business and took Wei Xiyan to live abroad for the long term. Therefore, the bond between them was not deep and was even somewhat distant.

Wei Xiyan, having lost both parents at a young age, became somewhat withdrawn, never proactively fitting in with others and never wanting to cause trouble for others. Ning Sinian, mature and steady, did not intentionally make things difficult for an orphan. They were supposed to live together in peace, not interfering with each other.

But things went wrong because Ning Sinian’s new wife, Zhao Xinfang, was a pure-looking yet venomous woman. Before marrying Ning Sinian, she had already been involved with his friend, Qian Yu. Qian Yu was a college classmate of Ning Sinian’s, and after graduating, he was invited by Ning Sinian to work as his personal assistant.

Personal assistants were mostly trusted people, which was a form of reliance and a way to train them. Once Qian Yu’s abilities met Ning Sinian’s expectations, he would naturally be given a more suitable position.

However, Qian Yu couldn’t wait. Coming from a poor background, he harbored a strong resentment toward the rich and had a pathological sense of pride. He saw being treated like a servant by Ning Sinian as an insult. He began to resent Ning Sinian, embezzling company assets and betraying the company’s interests, while also seducing Zhao Xinfang to secretly harm Ning Sinian.

But Ning Sinian, as the male lead of this world, was not so easy to deal with. Just when the two were about to succeed, the female lead appeared. Not only did she win Ning Sinian’s love, but she also exposed their conspiracy. In a series of life-threatening yet romantic confrontations, Wei Xiyan was merely an insignificant cannon fodder.

One day, he went out to buy paint and accidentally encountered Zhao Xinfang and Qian Yu sneaking out of a hotel. Fearing he would expose their affair to Ning Sinian and arouse his suspicion, they set up a poisonous plot to expel him from the Ning family.

Zhao Xinfang bribed the Ning family's maid, Wang Ma, to abuse Ning Wangshu and then secretly showed Ning Sinian the horrific scars on Ning Wangshu’s body, claiming that Wei Xiyan had beaten him while she was away. Ning Wangshu, barely two years old, had no clear sense of right and wrong. After being beaten and threatened by Wang Ma, when brought before Ning Sinian, he was terrified and kept repeating, "Uncle hit me."

After several rounds of abuse, Ning Wangshu developed autism and no longer cried or smiled. Ning Sinian naturally hated Wei Xiyan, expelling him from the house and even publicly severing ties. Zhao Xinfang’s plot served a double purpose: it removed the obstacle for her future child and kept her affair with her lover a secret.

Years later, Wang Ma retired, and the female lead came to apply as a maid. Under her gentle care, Ning Wangshu’s autism miraculously improved, and the female lead also exposed the conspiracy between Zhao Xinfang and Qian Yu. When Ning Sinian later sought out Wei Xiyan, he found that, after being abandoned by his family again, Wei Xiyan had committed suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.

Ning Sinian was deeply sorrowful and filled with guilt, and it took a lot of comfort from the female lead to get him back on his feet…

Wei Xiyan was the most innocent person in this story. He had never suspected Zhao Xinfang or Qian Yu, nor had he ever intended to tell Ning Sinian anything. Until his death, he never understood why he was expelled from the Ning family.

This character lived a very suffocating life, a hundred times worse than his predecessor. He was just a prop to enhance the relationship between the male and female leads.

After reading the information, Zhou Yunsheng tugged at his hair and sighed silently. So far, Wang Ma had already reported Wei Xiyan to Ning Sinian twice, with each report about the abuse of Ning Wangshu becoming more severe. Ning Sinian had planned to talk to Wei Xiyan, but Wei Xiyan, with his reclusive personality, would lock himself in the studio and refuse to come out whenever Ning Sinian tried to approach. This frustrated Ning Sinian, who could only instruct Wang Ma to keep a closer watch. Wang Ma, the real culprit, would never stop unless she thoroughly angered Ning Sinian.

When Wang Ma reported the abuse again, Wei Xiyan would be expelled from the house.

After the last transmigration, Zhou Yunsheng gradually figured out some tricks. To completely change the course of the world, one could alter the protagonist's fate, the original body's fate, other supporting characters, the historical process, or major events. However, the quickest way was still to change the protagonist's fate, followed by the original body's fate, and lastly the others. The further down the list, the more time and effort it would take.

As the villain, Zhou Yunsheng had fought the protagonist for several hundred to almost a thousand rounds, with a combined time that spanned at least tens of thousands of years. After breaking free from the system's control, he decided—unless the protagonist actively provoked him, he would never entangle with the protagonist again. It didn't matter if the progress was slow or the time was longer—after all, he no longer needed to race against the clock to complete tasks.

So, his best choice now was to change the original body's fate, and there was a lot of knowledge hidden within that. Helping the original body avoid danger was just the basic approach. Restoring the original body's reputation, fulfilling their unachieved wishes, and helping them achieve their dreams was the real way to make a thorough change.

Although Zhou Yunsheng could directly approach Ning Sian and explain everything, who would he believe? Wang Ma, who had served the Ning family for decades and personally raised him? Or a younger brother who had been with him for less than a year and was mentally unstable? The result was obvious.

Moreover, how could he explain that a boy with autism knew so much about the inner workings?

Zhou Yunsheng pondered for a long time and decided to use a more tactful yet more direct method to resolve the crisis. He put down his paintbrush, covered the canvas with a white cloth, and went back to the room to wash up.

In the mirror, a pale, emaciated yet handsome face appeared, with an ambiguous androgynous look typical of a young person. His light brown hair was soft and smooth, falling neatly at his ears, making people instinctively want to touch and caress it. His eyes, once sharp and bright, suddenly became dull and melancholic when they met the mirror.

After adjusting his temperament to match the original body’s exactly, Zhou Yunsheng took off his clothes and stepped into the shower. Due to the many life-threatening secrets he had uncovered on the internet, Zhou Yunsheng had long been accustomed to living a life of hiding and evading. He would hack into someone's identity, then disguise himself as that person, living their life for a while before changing to another, and so on. From appearance to personality, from temperament to habits, he could completely become someone else inside and out, and his flawless disguise earned him the fitting codename—"Impersonator."

As for the term "deicide" (god-killer), it was just a product of his phase of youthful rebellion.

Since he had taken over the original body, he would live entirely in the original body’s way, avoiding all dangers for them and fulfilling all their wishes. Now, he was the same as the original, Wei Xiyan, who had closed himself off after losing his parents.

After finishing his shower and changing into clean clothes, Ning Sian returned. Wang Ma had sent a maid upstairs to call Wei Xiyan for dinner.

As the male lead, Ning Sian was naturally extraordinarily handsome. His nearly 190 cm tall frame made him look good in whatever he wore. At that moment, he was sitting at the dining table, gently coaxing the silent and emotionless Ning Wangshu in his arms. Upon hearing footsteps, he furrowed his thick brows and cast a cold, disdainful glance over, his gaze carrying a deadly force.

The original Wei Xiyan had refused to communicate with him because he was terrified of that kind of gaze, losing his chance to explain himself. Zhou Yunsheng, however, was not afraid. But, as if startled, he shrank his neck and sat down in the farthest corner from him.

Zhao Xinfang softly said, "Sian, give me the baby. I'll feed him, you eat first." As she spoke, she carefully took Ning Wangshu into her arms, her lowered eyelids hiding the malice deep in her eyes.



==================================================
chapter2-2

Ning Wangshu had intended to tug at his father's sleeve, but upon catching the venomous glare from Wang Ma, he shuddered, then stiffened and allowed Zhao Xinfang to carry him away.

"Ah, open your mouth. This is the baby's favorite purple sweet potato rice porridge, so sweet and fragrant," Zhao Xinfang coaxed softly, her tone gentle and patient. Had it not been for Zhou Yunsheng already knowing her true nature, he might have almost been deceived by her.

Ning Sian had met Zhao Xinfang at an orphanage, where she volunteered to care for the children every weekend. Ning Sian had witnessed firsthand her tender, caring, and patient treatment of the children, which led him to consider marrying her. At this moment, he was quite pleased with her performance, and his usually cold face softened slightly.

Zhou Yunsheng ate his rice in small bites, his gaze fixed firmly on the bowl in front of him, not straying in the slightest.

After serving the dishes and cleaning the kitchen, Wang Ma wiped her hands and smiled, "Madam, let me feed the baby. You've had a long day."

Ning Wangshu’s face turned pale with fear, but because he had been intimidated by Wang Ma before, he just bit his lip silently and cried, not daring to resist. Wang Ma feigned surprise, "Oh dear, what’s happened? Just a moment ago, everything was fine, and now he's suddenly crying? The baby hasn’t spoken, eaten, or slept these past few days, and now he's crying without a sound. It’s truly heartbreaking. How did such a good child end up like this..."

As she spoke, tears welled up in her eyes, making her look even more pitiful than Ning Wangshu himself.

Ning Wangshu had become as stiff as a quail, huddling in her arms, not daring to even take a deep breath. Zhou Yunsheng could see at a glance that Ning Wangshu was terrified of Wang Ma, yet Ning Sian, who had grown up under Wang Ma’s care, remained unaware, completely blind to any signs.

Now, Zhou Yunsheng’s anger was piqued by Wang Ma’s words, and his cold, sharp gaze turned toward her. However, he restrained himself out of consideration for the child, barely holding back his emotions. He lifted his son gently, offering soft words of comfort and singing the lullaby that Wang Ma used to sing to him as a child. But instead of calming Ning Wangshu, the song only caused him to tremble.

With his heart in turmoil, Ning Sian hurriedly carried his son to the room, dialing the family doctor repeatedly. Wang Ma and Zhao Xinfang quickly followed them.

In the dining room, Zhou Yunsheng was left alone. He put down his bowl, wiped his mouth slowly, and washed his hands before heading to the room.

Wei Xiyan’s room was simply decorated, with a bookshelf filled with books on painting techniques. Most of the drawers were stuffed with paints and canvases from various brands. He was obviously a painting enthusiast, with nothing else in his life but his art.

But the current Zhou Yunsheng was a hacker, and he urgently needed a computer. After rummaging through the room for a while, he finally found a laptop under the bed, turned it on, and connected to the internet.

The dim light cast shadows on the delicate face, still androgynous in appearance. His expression was focused as his fingers moved across the keyboard with almost imperceptible speed. A few minutes later, his concentration was interrupted by a loud knocking on the door. He frowned in annoyance.

"Wei Xiyan, we need to talk. Come out!" Ning Sian's voice was low and firm as he knocked. When there was no response, he grew impatient and kicked the door.

Fortunately, the Ning family was wealthy, and the door was made of solid wood, well-crafted. It wouldn’t be easy to break it down without a couple of strong men.

Zhou Yunsheng relaxed his tense muscles, pursed his lips, and picked up a teacup from the desk, throwing it with force to show his resolute refusal to meet Ning Sian.

The original Wei Xiyan had feared talking to Ning Sian, but Zhou Yunsheng now simply didn’t want to talk to him. Ning Sian had already sentenced Wei Xiyan to death in his heart. No matter how much Wei Xiyan tried to explain, it was unlikely Ning Sian would listen.

Hearing the crash of the cup and seeing the tea spill onto the carpet, it was clear the person inside was on the verge of a breakdown. Thinking of his parents' repeated warning to "never provoke Xiyan," Ning Sian tugged at his tie and reluctantly stepped away. He had once photographed the bruises on his son’s body and sent them to his parents across the ocean, but no matter what, they refused to believe it, insisting that Wei Xiyan would never harm anyone.

Throwing a cup like that—was this not evidence of harm? If not him, could it have been Xinfang? Or Wang Ma? One was the gentle and kind wife, the other the caretaker who had treated him like a son. Ning Sian doubted anyone would suspect them. Besides, his son had clearly said it was his uncle who did it—at such a young age, how could he lie?

Hearing the footsteps fade, Zhou Yunsheng pressed the enter key and implanted a small program he had written into Ning Sian’s computer.

Ning Sinian sat by his son's bedside, watching the boy's restless sleep, his face still filled with fear despite the sedative. His heart twisted with pain. The family doctor's words echoed in his mind again and again:

"Mr. Ning, judging by the situation, your son has suffered psychological trauma from abuse. You need to find him a psychologist as soon as possible and keep him away from the source of his fear."

Keep him away from the source of his fear? Ning Sinian pondered for a moment, then quietly walked toward the study. In the dim hallway light, Zhao Xinfang stood waiting. Seeing him approach, she whispered, "I'm sorry, Sinian. I failed to take good care of the baby. Maybe I should quit my job at the orphanage? Wang Ma is looking after him alone, and sometimes it's just too much for her. Also, I've already contacted a psychologist—Dr. Sun Wen from the Department of Psychology at Kyoto Medical University. He specializes in children's psychological issues and is one of the top experts in the country. Here’s his card. Keep it for now. I’ll take the baby to his sessions every Wednesday."

"No need to quit. You only go on weekends; it doesn’t take up much time. Besides, a thief can hide for a thousand days, but no one can guard against them forever. I'll talk to my parents and try to get Wei Xiyan sent away as soon as possible. I was planning to reach out to Dr. Cullen, but you beat me to it. Dr. Sun Wen is a good choice, and he’s already in the country, which makes things convenient. Thank you, Xinfang." Ning Sinian took the card and examined it carefully.

Zhao Xinfang noticed how exhausted he looked. She hesitated but ultimately said nothing. The brothers barely spent any time together, and their relationship was distant. Who knew if, in the future, when they grew closer, Wei Xiyan might spill everything about that day? But for now, her plan had worked perfectly, and she had even managed to turn Ning Wangshu into an imbecile. The satisfaction bubbling in her heart was indescribable.

She quietly shut the door behind her and smiled.

Ning Sinian walked to the window, lit a cigarette, and took deep drags. The orange ember flickered rapidly, mirroring his restless mind. He finished the cigarette in less than half a minute before turning on the desk lamp and calling his parents.

"The number you dialed is turned off..."

"The number you dialed is turned off..."

"The number you dialed..."

After several failed attempts, he irritably tossed his phone aside, accidentally nudging the mouse and waking his computer from sleep mode. A pop-up ad appeared, its bright orange text catching his eye.

He was about to close it when he suddenly froze.

"Are you worried about theft in your home? Concerned about lazy housekeepers? Angry that your child is being abused by a nanny? Pinhole cameras—solving all your troubles! □□, professional installation at your doorstep, convenient and practical..."

Ning Sinian didn’t bother reading further. A sharp gleam flashed in his eyes.

If his parents refused to believe him, he would present them with undeniable proof. With solid evidence, even if Wei Xiyan refused to leave, Ning Sinian would have him thrown out—and make him pay a heavy price.

He picked up his phone again and called Zhao Jun.

Zhao Jun lived on the west side of the Ning family estate. A former mercenary, he now served as Ning Sinian’s driver and bodyguard, handling many of his more unsavory tasks. When he received the call, he didn’t ask any questions and quickly prepared a full set of surveillance equipment.

The next day, while Ning Sinian was at work, Zhao Jun pretended to clean the air conditioning vents while installing pinhole cameras throughout the Ning household—even in the bathrooms. He also placed a tiny, rice-sized listening device inside the longevity locket worn by Ning Wangshu.

It was summer vacation, so Zhou Yunsheng didn’t have school. After breakfast, he locked himself in the art studio. Now that he had taken Wei Xiyan’s place, he naturally had to fulfill Wei Xiyan’s dream.

And there was no doubt—Wei Xiyan’s dream was to become a great artist.

Sensing the presence of new surveillance devices in the house, Zhou Yunsheng’s already neutral mood brightened. He reached out his slender, fair fingers and lifted the white cloth covering the canvas.

It was a nearly finished pastoral landscape, depicting the Ning estate. Under the golden sunlight, a garden bloomed with roses and climbing vines, painted in warm tones that exuded a sense of joy. To be fair, Wei Xiyan did have some natural talent for painting. However, his narrow perspective and reclusive personality prevented him from capturing deeper emotions in his work.

His paintings were delicate and beautiful, offering visual enjoyment, but they failed to touch the soul.

Zhou Yunsheng had experienced hundreds, if not thousands, of lifetimes. Although he had always played the villain, one undeniable fact remained—without a certain level of skill, how could he ever stand against the protagonist?

In every reincarnation, while fulfilling his assigned role, he had also honed a variety of talents. He had been a scholar, a grand advisor, an emperor, a cultivator. He had also been a knight, a duke, a pope, a sorcerer. These experiences had brought him immeasurable suffering but also granted him invaluable knowledge.

His repertoire of skills was vast and eclectic, and of course, painting was among them. Whether it was traditional Chinese painting, oil painting, sketching, or watercolor—give him a brush, and he could create an entire world.

His mastery of painting was far beyond Wei Xiyan’s. In fact, in this entire world, there wasn’t a single person who could compare to him.

Fulfilling Wei Xiyan’s dream was effortless for Zhou Yunsheng.

He leisurely studied Wei Xiyan’s artwork, analyzing his painting techniques. The room was silent except for the rustling of leaves in the breeze.

At that moment, a small figure stepped inside.

The child stood hesitantly at the door, seemingly captivated by the scene on the canvas. Step by step, he cautiously made his way over, his movements light as a feather.

Just as Zhou Yunsheng finished analyzing Wei Xiyan’s style and turned to grab his brush and palette, he found himself locking eyes with Ning Wangshu.

Both of them were naturally reserved, so they startled each other. They stared, wide-eyed and motionless, exchanging a silent gaze.

After a long pause, Zhou Yunsheng slowly—very slowly—reached out his hand, picking up the palette from a stool beside Ning Wangshu.

Ning Wangshu had been planning to step back, but seeing that he wasn’t the target of the movement, he stopped and tilted his head up to watch.

Zhou Yunsheng paid him no mind. He diluted the paint and started applying strokes to the canvas.

Uncle and nephew stood side by side—one painting, the other watching intently. Their similarly delicate features bore the same blank expressions.

The scene was somewhat amusing, yet at the same time, incredibly heartwarming and endearing.

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 2.3
When Ning Wangshu met Zhou Yunsheng’s gaze, his entire body tensed up, ready to flee on his short little legs at any moment. However, Zhou Yunsheng carefully avoided him, merely picking up the palette and paintbrush beside him before turning to his canvas without any further actions.

Ning Wangshu secretly let out a breath of relief and shuffled closer, step by step, tilting his small head up to watch the painting with sparkling eyes.

Zhou Yunsheng, entirely absorbed in his work, had long stopped noticing the tiny figure at his feet. He had inherited Wei Xiyan’s passion for painting completely, his brush never pausing as it glided over the canvas.

Wei Xiyan excelled in modern direct painting, sketching outlines on the canvas before slowly adding color. However, Zhou Yunsheng specialized in an even older technique—glazing—where layers of paint, thinned with oil but without added white, were meticulously applied. Each layer had to dry completely before the next was added, meaning that before he even began, the entire painting had already taken shape in his mind.

Because each layer of paint was thin, the colors underneath subtly shone through, blending with the upper layers to create delicate tonal variations. This method required exceptional skill and precise control over color harmonization.

Wei Xiyan’s painting featured large areas of warm tones, which had already dried. Zhou Yunsheng now added layers of blue, purple, and green on top, gradually transforming the warmth into a cooler palette. Finally, he glazed the surface with resin varnish, creating a layered interplay of grays.

In just half an hour, a once vibrant garden bursting with spring blossoms had turned into a starlit forest. The sky shimmered with countless twinkling stars, their faint glow so lifelike it seemed one could pluck them straight from the canvas. The painting did not merely resemble a piece of art—it looked like a gateway to another world, breathtakingly real yet hauntingly surreal.

Zhou Yunsheng took a few steps back to examine his work when a soft gasp of amazement reached his ears. Only then did he snap out of his artistic trance and lower his gaze to the little one standing at his feet.

Day had turned to night, sunlight to starlight, a garden to a forest. Even though Ning Wangshu was too young to understand aesthetics, he was still completely awed by his uncle’s extraordinary skill.

Realizing that he had disturbed his uncle, Ning Wangshu hurriedly clapped his chubby hands over his mouth, his wide eyes filled with panic.

But Zhou Yunsheng merely cast him a brief glance before turning back to scrutinize his painting, picking up the brush for minor adjustments.

Ning Wangshu let out another sigh of relief. Seeing that his uncle had no intention of driving him away, his courage gradually grew. He reached out toward the brushes resting on the stool—stretching out, pulling back, stretching out, pulling back. After much hesitation, he finally grasped one in his tiny hands.

A bucket of cleaning oil sat on the floor beside a few white cloths. Quick as a flash, Ning Wangshu dipped his brush into a bit of poppy oil and crouched down, smearing it across the white cloth. He tried to paint a few stars, but when he realized they weren’t as dazzling as his uncle’s, he scowled and turned them into suns instead…

Completely engrossed in his play, he failed to notice that Zhou Yunsheng had finished his final touches and was now bending over, watching him intently.

“You can’t play with this.”

The teenager’s voice was as gentle as a murmuring brook, yet the force with which he took the brush from Ning Wangshu’s hands left no room for argument.

The little boy was stunned. His rosy face instantly turned pale, and like a frightened quail, he shrank into the corner.

Zhou Yunsheng didn’t comfort him. He simply placed the brush and oil bucket on the windowsill, making sure they were out of reach before walking out of the studio.

Ning Wangshu covered his face, tears pattering down onto the white cloth, soaking it in large patches. He looked utterly pitiful.

But not long after, the teenager returned, holding a box of watercolor pens and a stack of white paper. He crouched down, handing them over as he spoke slowly and clearly, “Use these instead. Paint and poppy oil contain trace amounts of toxins. Babies shouldn’t touch them—you’ll get sick.”

Ning Wangshu kept crying and refused to look up. Seeing this, Zhou Yunsheng didn’t press further. He simply set down the supplies and turned back to his work. He wasn’t the talkative type to begin with, so saying this much was already a miracle.

So Uncle wasn’t annoyed with him after all.

The weight in Ning Wangshu’s little heart suddenly lifted. He rubbed his eyes hard before sneaking a glance up. Just as he reached out to grab the watercolor pens, his uncle abruptly turned toward him. Startled, he immediately curled up into a ball, hugging his head like a tiny turtle.

Zhou Yunsheng was almost amused by the little one’s reaction, but with surveillance cameras covering the entire studio, he had to restrain himself. He took several deep breaths, maintaining a serious expression as he removed a white shirt hanging on the easel.

He helped the child put it on, his voice low, “Wear this properly so you don’t dirty your clothes.”

Ning Wangshu stopped struggling and obediently let his uncle dress him. The shirt was oversized—its sleeves had to be rolled up multiple times just to reveal his plump little hands, and the hem draped so long it completely covered his pants.

Zhou Yunsheng straightened the collar, then, somewhat awkwardly, ruffled the little one’s head before turning back to his painting.

Ning Wangshu also touched his own forehead, savoring the lingering warmth. His heart felt sweet and light. He didn’t smile, but his eyes had never shone so brightly. Gripping the watercolor pen, he began to doodle, imitating his uncle’s masterpiece.

The studio fell into a serene stillness, so quiet that even the sound of a pin drop could be heard. Side by side, the uncle and nephew painted together, their harmonious presence filling the space with a warmth that melted the heart.

Time slipped away unnoticed. It wasn’t until four or five in the afternoon that Wang Ma finally strolled into the house, carrying a vegetable basket.

There was another maid in the household, so she wasn’t needed to watch over the child at all times. Besides, at her age, she had little patience for babysitting. Every day, as soon as Ning Sinian left the house, she would grab her basket under the pretense of grocery shopping—only to sneak off to the nearby park for a game of cards with the other housemaids.

Having once been discreet about her laziness in front of Zhao Xinfang, she now acted with increasing brazenness after benefiting from her generosity. Zhao Xinfang, contrary to what Ning Sinian had assumed, was not simply staying home to care for her stepson whenever she wasn’t volunteering. She, too, was frequently out and about—shopping, playing cards, or indulging in beauty treatments.

Since Ning Sinian was always busy and seldom home, returning late even when he did, she—just like Wang Ma—only needed to ensure she was back before six in the evening.

Today was Sunday. Using the orphanage as an excuse, she planned to return even later.

Wang Ma inquired with the maids and, upon learning that Zhao Xinfang had not yet come home, went upstairs to find Ning Wangshu.

In the art studio, the moment Ning Wangshu heard Wang Ma’s voice calling out, his face turned deathly pale, and his small body trembled uncontrollably.

Zhou Yunsheng gently patted his little head in reassurance before helping him remove his shirt and wash his hands.

The old Wei Xiyan had noticed something amiss with Ning Wangshu before. He had once mustered the courage to inquire after hearing the child’s heart-wrenching cries.

But Wang Ma had dismissed it with a simple explanation: the boy was suffering from tooth decay, and the pain made him cry.

Though Wei Xiyan remained suspicious, he hesitated for a long time before finally managing to squeeze out an embarrassed “Really?” under Wang Ma’s sharp glare, ultimately retreating in defeat.

As soon as he left, Wang Ma shut the door and continued beating Ning Wangshu, not treating him as anything more than an inconvenience.

Now, however, Zhou Yunsheng didn’t regard Wang Ma with any significance either. He gently cradled the little boy, patiently soothing him.

When Wang Ma finally found them and demanded that the child be handed over, he not only refused but slammed the door in her face, nearly causing her to bump her nose.

“You wretched little bastard! Who do you think you are? One day, Sinian will throw you out!” she spat venomously at the closed door.

Zhou Yunsheng paid no heed to the curses outside. After setting the child down, he continued painting.

Only his little uncle could see his fear and despair. Only his little uncle would not hand him over to Wang Ma. Only his little uncle would protect him so resolutely.

Though it was merely a door being shut, it felt like a barrier shielding him from all dangers.

At just three years old, Ning Wangshu had already developed a sense of self. At this moment, he felt an unshakable attachment to Zhou Yunsheng. At the same time, he vaguely understood that the words he had spoken to his father might bring trouble to his little uncle.

A mix of joy and sorrow swelled in his heart as he carefully wrapped his arms around his little uncle’s leg.

Zhou Yunsheng nudged him disdainfully, but his touch was feather-light.

For once, Ning Wangshu did not cower. Instead, he clung on persistently.

Try as he might, Zhou Yunsheng couldn’t shake off this little tail of his. In the end, he could only resign himself to the embrace.

If he moved left, the little one would stumble after him; if he moved right, the child would totter in pursuit, sticking to him like an unshakable shadow—a sight so ridiculous it was almost comical.

While the uncle and nephew played happily, Wang Ma was relieved to not have to deal with them. She hurried the maids to prepare her meal.

But before five-thirty, the sound of an engine roaring outside startled her—Ning Sinian was back early.

Panic surged through Wang Ma at the thought of the harmonious scene in the art studio. She rushed upstairs and whispered urgently, “Wei Xiyan, hurry and bring the child out! If Mr. Ning sees you with him, he’ll throw you out for sure!”

The old Wei Xiyan, wary of Ning Sinian’s growing coldness and disdain, had indeed been afraid to get too close to Ning Wangshu.

Zhou Yunsheng, however, knowing the truth, had no intention of exposing Wang Ma’s little charade. Calmly, he opened the door and led the frightened boy out.

Ning Wangshu felt his little forehead being rubbed. The warmth eased his fear. He also understood that as long as his father was home, Wang Ma wouldn’t dare to hurt him. Steeling himself, he took stiff, hesitant steps forward.

Wang Ma wasted no time in yanking him to her side, half-dragging him downstairs without caring if he could keep up. She hissed in a low voice, “You are never to be with Wei Xiyan again, or I’ll skin you alive!”

“Little Uncle is not a bastard.”

For the first time in a long while, Ning Wangshu spoke—his voice strikingly clear.

Wang Ma froze for a moment, then her face twisted with rage. She reached out and viciously twisted his ear.

The little boy hunched his shoulders and curled inward, enduring in silence.

Fortunately, Ning Sinian had already started upstairs in his haste to see his son. Wang Ma quickly let go, scooping the child into her arms.

With a bright smile plastered on her face, she leaned close and whispered through gritted teeth, “Not only is Wei Xiyan a bastard, but so are you. If you don’t obey me, I’ll throw you into the river and drown you. Your father has a new wife, and soon, he’ll have many new children. He won’t care about you at all.”

Terror consumed Ning Wangshu. His tiny hands clenched into fists, his eyes squeezing shut as tears streamed silently down his face.

Chapter 2.4
Early in the morning, Ning Sinian drove out alone—not to the company, but to the nearest underground parking lot, where he hid, put on his headphones, and eavesdropped on the sounds from home. Zhao Jun remained in the west wing, keeping an eye on the surveillance monitors. If Wei Xiyan showed the slightest hint of hostility toward Ning Wangshu, he would rush over to intervene, sending the footage straight to Ning’s parents overseas.

Ning Sinian was tense the moment he put on the headphones. The image of his son’s terrified expression was still etched into his mind, impossible to dispel. He feared even the slightest harm befalling him, his entire focus locked onto the headset, ready to step on the gas and race home at the first sign of trouble.

The listening device was hidden within the hollowed-out pendant of a longevity locket, delivering crystal-clear audio. He heard the housekeeper, Wang Ma, sternly warning his son not to run around. The child remained silent, followed by a long stretch of silence.

Ning Sinian sat in the same position, gripping the steering wheel from morning until early afternoon, shifting from nervous anticipation to numbness. Just as he was about to succumb to the stillness, a voice as clear and crisp as a mountain spring rang out:

“No, you can’t play with that.”

It was Wei Xiyan’s signature flat tone. Ning Sinian immediately sat up straight, holding his breath, straining to discern any underlying emotion in his voice. Yet, surprisingly, there was none—no malice, no hostility. His sharp instincts told him as much, but still, he placed his hand on the ignition, prepared to start the engine.

Before he could press down, that same clear voice sounded again. The tone remained flat, but the concern embedded in each syllable was unmistakable.

“If you use this to paint, the pigments and poppy oil contain trace toxins. Little ones shouldn’t touch them—it’ll make you sick.”

So, he was merely stopping his son from playing with oil paints. A perfectly reasonable action.

Ning Sinian exhaled deeply, retracting his hand from the ignition, resting his weary forehead against the steering wheel.

Another silence followed. When Wei Xiyan spoke again, Ning Sinian had already trained himself to remain calm.

“Put this on properly, so you don’t get your clothes dirty.”

He was helping the child put on a smock to protect his clothes—another perfectly reasonable act. Ning Sinian frowned, struggling to reconcile this gentle, attentive youth with the violent, volatile figure Wang Ma had described.

Had they misjudged the situation? Or was the boy simply adept at deception? But no matter how well he feigned kindness, wouldn’t the victim instinctively know to stay away from him?

Yet, through the headset, he could hear his son’s light, eager footsteps—clearly, it was the child himself who had wandered into the studio.

Ning Sinian removed his headphones, raking a hand through his hair, finally making up his mind—he had to return home at once.

The moment his car pulled into the driveway, Zhao Jun emerged from the west wing, lowering his voice.

“Boss, you’d better check the surveillance footage yourself. Maybe we’ve been wrong all along.”

Ning Sinian nodded and strode past him, heading upstairs. At the landing, he nearly bumped into Wang Ma, who was carrying his son.

The child’s face was as pale as a sheet, his large eyes brimming with unshed tears, his expression fraught with terror. Yet, through the headset, he had barely made a sound all day. The quiet rustling of a paintbrush against paper had been the only sign of his presence, conveying a sense of peace—even contentment.

Why had everything changed the moment he returned?

Suspicion coiled tighter in Ning Sinian’s chest. Taking his son from Wang Ma’s arms, he was startled to find the boy resisting his touch, his tear-filled gaze filled with resentment.

A sharp, piercing ache lanced through Ning Sinian’s heart. More than ever, he needed to know what had truly transpired in this seemingly uneventful day.

“Wang Ma, take him to the garden to see the ducklings. I’ll join you after I change.”

Handing the child back, he turned and strode toward his study.

He opened his computer without hesitation, pulling up the day’s surveillance footage. The hidden cameras followed Ning Wangshu’s movements, shifting angles as he moved.

Wang Ma had gone out early to buy groceries, leaving the child alone in the living room, sitting motionless on the carpet, playing with his toys without the slightest change in expression—like an empty shell devoid of a soul.

He remained there until noon when a maid entered with lunch, placing the tray down before leaving without so much as a word of encouragement. She didn’t even attempt to coax him into eating.

Yet, the boy was well-behaved, nibbling at a piece of cake, taking small sips of milk, before slowly making his way toward the studio.

Ning Sinian’s dark brows furrowed. If Wei Xiyan had truly been abusing his son, why would the child seek him out on his own?

Suppressing his growing unease, he continued watching.

At the studio door, the little boy peeked inside, hesitating for a long moment. Seeing that Wei Xiyan was wholly absorbed in his painting, he finally took tentative steps forward.

As the teenager turned to fetch a brush, their gazes met.

Ning Sinian tensed instinctively, his fists clenching, fearing that the boy might lash out in a fit of violence. But nothing happened. Wei Xiyan merely shifted to avoid the child and continued painting.

The terror in the boy’s eyes dissipated almost instantly, replaced by an awed expression.

The light that rekindled in those dark, lifeless eyes nearly brought tears to Ning Sinian’s own.

Then came the moment he had overheard—Wei Xiyan stopping the child from playing with the paints, helping him put on a smock, gently tousling his hair with a quiet tenderness.

As the boy reached up to touch his forehead where those fingers had just been, his wide eyes shimmered with unspoken attachment.

Who would ever long for the touch of someone who had beaten them?

A sharp pang tightened Ning Sinian’s chest. Stifling his rising anxiety, he kept watching.

A tall and a small figure stood side by side, each with their own easel. Wei Xiyan’s canvas shimmered with starlight, while the boy’s was a dark, chaotic mess of colors—its subject unidentifiable. But he was happy, tugging at the teenager’s sleeve, eager for his approval.

Wei Xiyan didn’t speak but ruffled his hair in silent praise. The boy’s eyes lit up with uncontainable joy.

Unaware of himself, Ning Sinian had begun to smile—a soft, unconscious curve of the lips. The sharpness in his gaze had long since melted into something far gentler. As he watched the two figures on the screen, for the first time in what felt like forever, the world seemed peaceful.

But the moment was shattered by Wang Ma’s sudden shouting.

The child flinched violently, his face draining of color. His earlier warmth and vitality vanished, replaced by the all-too-familiar look of sheer terror.

Wang Ma appeared at the doorway, calling the boy over.

Wei Xiyan moved first, stepping forward and slamming the door shut with force.

Miraculously, Ning Wangshu stopped trembling. Instead, he clung to Wei Xiyan’s leg, his small face filled with reverence and unwavering trust—as though the boy standing before him was his hero.

Ning Sinian stared at the screen in shock, his heart sinking lower and lower until it plunged into an icy abyss. A vague sense of deception crept into his mind. He fast-forwarded the footage and saw Wang Ma pounding on the door with frenzied intensity. When it finally opened, she yanked the child inside with brutal force, her twisted expression revealing the sheer malice she harbored toward him.

Ning Sinian instantly stopped fast-forwarding, and Wang Ma's venomous voice pierced his eardrums—

"From now on, you’re not allowed to be around Wei Xiyan, that little bastard! Or I’ll skin you alive! Not only is Wei Xiyan a bastard, but so are you! If you don’t obey me, I’ll throw you into the river and drown you. Your father has a new wife now. He’ll have plenty of other children in the future—he won’t care about you at all."

So that was the truth! So this was how Wang Ma treated his child behind his back! The veins on Ning Sinian’s forehead bulged as rage surged through him, nearly driving him to madness. If he still failed to see the reality before him, he would be a complete fool.

The thought that he had just entrusted his son to Wang Ma sent him bolting out the door.

Meanwhile, Zhou Yunsheng had quietly returned to his room upon Ning Sinian’s arrival. He activated his smart device and effortlessly hacked into Ning Sinian’s surveillance system within seconds. Zhao Jun had been meticulous in his work—several cameras had even been installed in Ning Sinian’s study and bedroom to prevent unauthorized access. Zhou Yunsheng pulled up the feed from the study and stirred his coffee leisurely as he watched Ning Sinian’s face shift from pale to dark with amusement.

After he’d had his fill, he took a small sip of coffee, then walked over to the door, his gaze landing on the lawn outside. Wang Ma was there with Ning Wangshu, who was standing rigidly beside her, his tiny frame trembling in palpable fear. Her fingers were clamped tightly around his arm, rendering him too terrified to move.

If Zhou Yunsheng were still the villainous Zhou Yunsheng, he would have walked right over and snapped Wang Ma’s neck without hesitation. But now, he was Wei Xiyan, and Wei Xiyan’s hands were meant for painting, not for bloodshed.

What a pity... He lowered his gaze with a sigh. Hearing Ning Sinian’s hurried footsteps approaching, he immediately turned back into his room.

As Ning Sinian rushed down the hallway, he nearly bumped into Wei Xiyan. His expression flickered with a trace of guilt and awkwardness, but his son was still in Wang Ma’s grasp—there was no time for distractions. He merely gave a quick nod before sprinting toward the lawn.

Seeing Zhao Jun standing nearby, watching Wang Ma with a sharp, predatory gaze, Ning Sinian felt a slight relief.

Ning Wangshu stood stiffly by Wang Ma’s side, shoulders hunched, head down. Wang Ma held a small, yellow duckling in her hands, trying to press its soft feathers against his cheek. His eyes were stretched wide in terror, as if the creature in her hands wasn’t a harmless little duckling, but a monstrous beast poised to devour him whole.

He had been beaten into submission, stripped of the courage to resist. And yet, his own family had turned a blind eye to his suffering, time and again handing him over to the devil.

No wonder he was so wary of him.
No wonder he harbored resentment toward him.
No wonder he clung to Wei Xiyan with such desperate devotion, all because he had simply closed a door for him.

Ning Sinian’s heart was torn apart by the weight of these belated realizations, each one slicing deeper than the last. The pain was unbearable. For a moment, he nearly shed tears.

But he was, after all, the head of the Ning family, a business tycoon known as the "cunning fox." By the time he reached his son, his emotions were carefully composed. With a warm smile, he scooped the boy into his arms and gently said, "Look at you, all covered in dirt from playing. Let’s get you cleaned up. Wang Ma, go prepare some steamed egg custard for him."

Wang Ma suspected nothing, setting the duckling down before heading to the kitchen.

Ning Sinian carried his silent, expressionless son back to the bedroom. After locking the door, he placed him gently on the bed and knelt before him. The usual cold sharpness in his features had softened, revealing nothing but sorrow and remorse.

"Baby, I’m sorry. Daddy is so, so sorry." He kissed his son’s forehead over and over again, but no matter how many times he did, he could no longer see a single flicker of emotion in his son’s eyes.

Ning Wangshu was utterly numb—his disappointment had long since solidified into quiet despair.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Chapter 2.5
Ning Wangshu couldn’t hear Ning Sinian’s apology at all. He simply gazed at his father in silence, his dark eyes unwavering.

Ning Sinian held him tightly, pressing kisses to his forehead and the crown of his head. It took him several minutes to calm his emotions before he hoarsely asked, "Baby, tell Daddy, who hit you? Was it Nanny Wang?"

Ning Wangshu trembled but remained silent.

Ning Sinian anxiously patted his back and repeated the question several times. Seeing his continued silence, he could only reassure him, "Baby, don’t be afraid. Daddy will protect you." He hesitated, suppressing the guilt in his heart before continuing, "As long as you tell me, Daddy will punish the bad person. But if you keep avoiding it out of fear, Daddy will have no choice but to send Uncle Xiyan away…"

“No!”

After nearly two weeks of silence, Ning Wangshu finally let out a panicked cry.

Ning Sinian’s heart clenched. Forcing himself to remain calm, he pressed on, “No what? You don’t want Uncle Xiyan to leave? Then tell Daddy—who hurt you? If you don’t tell me, how can I protect you? You are my only child, my most precious treasure. How could I not care about you? Do you understand?”

He softened his voice, coaxing his son to lower his guard.

Ning Wangshu struggled for a long time before finally whispering, "Don’t send Uncle Xiyan away. It was Nanny Wang who hit me… not him."

At last, he lifted his tear-filled eyes to meet his father’s gaze.

Ning Sinian’s own eyes reddened. He cradled the boy’s head, planting tender kisses before pulling him into his embrace, treating him as if he were a fragile treasure returned from the brink of loss.

If it weren’t for the surveillance cameras, he might have remained blind to the truth forever. Who would have thought that the ever-diligent Nanny Wang, who had practically raised him, was the real culprit? If he had driven Wei Xiyan away, his son would have only suffered more, and his symptoms of withdrawal would have worsened. All of his resentment, hatred, and anger had been misdirected—unleashed upon an innocent youth—while Nanny Wang would have likely laughed at his foolishness in secret.

Realizing this, Ning Sinian’s face burned red with shame, as if he had been slapped a dozen times over.

Meanwhile, through the smart device on his wrist, Zhou Yunsheng observed Ning Sinian’s distressed expression. Lowering his head to avoid the hidden camera, he chuckled to himself.

Stretching lazily, he stood up and began undressing as he walked toward the bathroom. But as soon as he stepped under the shower, his muscles tensed slightly.

It seemed Zhao Jun had even installed hidden cameras in the bathroom—and more than just one. What meticulous effort.

Zhou Yunsheng smirked, then continued his shower as if nothing had happened.

Ning Sinian was a straight man. He probably had no interest in watching another man bathe. And even if he did, so what? It wasn’t as if losing a few glimpses of flesh would cost him anything.

Having played the villain countless times, Zhou Yunsheng had abandoned both shame and dignity long ago.

After learning the truth from his son, Ning Sinian carefully bathed and dressed him, repeatedly promising to send Nanny Wang away. Ning Wangshu was delighted, yet after being tormented by fear for so long, he had even forgotten how to smile. He could only tug at the corners of his lips slightly, which made Ning Sinian’s heart ache.

Known as the "Cunning Fox" in the business world, Ning Sinian was no fool. It was obvious to him that there had to be a deeper reason behind his son’s abuse. Why would Nanny Wang, who had served the Ning family for decades and raised him devotedly, suddenly change so drastically? She wasn’t a sadist—there was no personal gratification to be gained from hurting his son. So what, exactly, was her motive?

Ning Sinian firmly believed that self-interest was the driving force behind human actions. If Nanny Wang had tormented his son, it was because she had something to gain from it. But who would benefit from both his son’s suffering and Wei Xiyan’s expulsion?

A name came to mind, and his brow furrowed deeply. If it truly was her, then the situation was far more complicated than he had imagined.

Father and son lingered in their room for a long time, slowly rediscovering a sense of warmth and closeness.

Then, the bedroom door opened, and Zhao Xinfang walked in, carrying her handbag. She sounded weary as she said, “Sinian, Nanny Wang asked you both to come down for dinner. I’ll change my clothes first, so don’t wait for me.”

Ning Sinian acknowledged her with a brief reply before carrying his son downstairs.

Upon entering the dining room, his gaze fell on the young man sitting in the corner, his damp hair clinging to his forehead. Softly, he asked, "Why didn’t you dry your hair before coming down?"

A faint, self-mocking thought crossed Zhou Yunsheng’s mind: Isn’t your concern a little too late?

But outwardly, his cheeks flushed slightly as he lowered his head, feigning a startled reaction.

Ning Sinian sighed helplessly, not daring to press further for fear of frightening him.

In the past, whenever he saw Wei Xiyan avoid his gaze, he had always assumed it was out of guilt. Now, he realized it was because of shyness. The hardships of his childhood had forced him to close off his heart… just like his son.

At this thought, Ning Sinian’s heart softened immeasurably. He swore to himself that from now on, he would take good care of the boy and never let him suffer again.

Nanny Wang, who had just entered the room, was visibly startled by Ning Sinian’s sudden shift in attitude. She nearly dropped the plate in her hands.

At that moment, Zhao Xinfang came downstairs, and their eyes met briefly in silent exchange.

Dinner carried an air of quiet tension. Ning Wangshu nestled in his father’s arms, obediently taking bite after bite of food. His bright eyes occasionally flickered toward his little uncle, filled with a newfound sense of ease and happiness.

Zhou Yunsheng, on the other hand, focused solely on eating. Once he had finished, he lowered his head and returned to his room, avoiding eye contact with anyone.

Did you eat your fill, sweetheart? If you're done, let's go to the study and read with Daddy.

Seeing that his son refused to take another bite, Ning Sinian gently wiped his mouth.

Ning Wangshu nodded, his eyes lighting up slightly. He was secretly terrified that his father might hand him over to Nanny Wang again.

Ning Sinian kissed his son on the forehead and carried him upstairs.

Ning Wangshu had always been an obedient and quiet child—he could play with a set of building blocks for hours. Ning Sinian sat him on his lap, scattering the blocks across the large desk, letting him play as he pleased while he himself focused on the surveillance monitor.

Across the hall, in another room, Zhou Yunsheng lay sprawled on the bed, wearing an oversized white shirt with nothing on his lower body, his long, fair legs dangling lazily. He flipped through an illustrated book with a leisurely air, occasionally glancing at the AI monitor. Watching Ning Sinian's face shift through emotions was one of his favorite pastimes—especially when anticipating Zhao Xinfang and Nanny Wang’s next move.

Once Ning Sinian was far enough away, Zhao Xinfang set down her chopsticks and asked, "Nanny Wang, you didn’t do anything today?"

"I was playing mahjong with my friends and lost track of time. Tomorrow, I promise I'll take care of it," Nanny Wang replied in a low voice.

"Do it fast. Every time I see Wei Xiyan, I feel sick to my stomach. And hit hard—cripple that little bastard if you can. Anyway, Wei Xiyan will take the fall for you. What are you afraid of?" Zhao Xinfang chuckled as if she found the whole thing amusing.

Nanny Wang nodded eagerly. "Got it, got it. And about the money we agreed on..."

"As soon as Wei Xiyan is out of this house, I’ll transfer it to you. If that little bastard ends up a brain-dead idiot, I'll throw in an extra five hundred thousand." Zhao Xinfang made the promise with ease.

Nanny Wang beamed with delight, swearing she’d get the job done the very next day.

Neither of them realized that a tiny surveillance camera was hidden inside the vase on the dining table, capturing every expression, movement, and word—transmitting the evidence straight to a computer screen.

Sitting before the screen, Ning Sinian’s face had twisted into something monstrous, his eyes blazing with fury. Though he had long suspected these two, hearing it with his own ears made him want to tear them apart, piece by piece!

Sensing his father’s sudden shift in mood, Ning Wangshu shuddered involuntarily.

Ning Sinian snapped out of his rage, forcing himself to suppress the seething emotions. He kissed the crown of his son's head, lowering his gaze in deep contemplation. Zhao Xinfang wanted to eliminate his son to clear the way for her own future child—this part, he understood. But why was she so determined to drive Wei Xiyan out of the Ning family?

Wei Xiyan had inherited an enormous fortune from his parents; he had no interest in the Ning family's assets. In fact, his heart and soul belonged only to painting, detached from all worldly matters.

What threat could he possibly pose to Zhao Xinfang?

There had to be something deeper at play.

Lost in thought, time slipped away. When he came back to his senses, Ning Wangshu had already dozed off on the desk. Ning Sinian carried him to his bed, gently tucked him in, kissed his forehead, and sat beside him for a long while before finally leaving.

By then, Zhao Jun was already waiting in the study with Nanny Wang, restrained.

"You're getting old, Nanny Wang. You should go home and rest." Ning Sinian seated himself in the leather chair, speaking with chilling directness.

Nanny Wang’s heart pounded violently, but her face was full of tears. "I can still work for a few more years. And now that the baby has been harmed like this, how can I bear to leave? Sinian, I know you care about me, but I care about you and the little one even more. To me, you are like my own son and grandson."

Ning Sinian sneered coldly. "Fifty grand was all it took for you to beat your ‘own grandson’ to death. I wouldn’t dare accept that kind of love."

Nanny Wang's face turned deathly pale, her mouth opening and closing as if to argue, but then she saw Ning Sinian turn the computer screen toward her—displaying the very footage of her conspiring with Zhao Xinfang.

There was nothing left to deny. In a panic, she spilled everything—how Zhao Xinfang had been caught in an affair by Wei Xiyan, how she had schemed with Nanny Wang to drive him out of the house. Desperately, she reminisced about the past, attempting to stir sentimentality in the enraged man before her.

Zhao Xinfang… Qian Yu… Ning Sinian repeated the names in his mind, his deep eyes gradually filling with a murderous red.

"Nanny Wang fell while getting up for a drink at night and broke her legs. I feel sorry for her, so I’m letting her recuperate in the hospital for a few months. Can you take care of this for me?" He turned to Zhao Jun, his gaze sharp as a blade.

A man like Zhao Jun, who had survived countless battlefields, still found himself momentarily stunned by that cold, ruthless stare. Steadying himself, he pulled out a syringe and plunged it into Nanny Wang’s neck.

Her eyes rolled back as she collapsed to the ground.

Zhao Jun circled her twice before crouching down and, with a practiced motion, snapped her left leg. The crisp crack of breaking bone sent a shiver down the spine.

But for Ning Sinian, it wasn’t enough. He spoke lightly, "The right one too."

Zhao Jun obeyed without hesitation. With both of her legs broken, he threw her over his shoulder. Seeing no one in the corridor, he left as silently as he had come.

Only then did Ning Sinian rise from his chair, walking toward the floor-to-ceiling window. He lit a cigarette and exhaled slowly, his gaze flickering as he turned back to the surveillance monitor.

On the screen, Wei Xiyan had unknowingly fallen asleep on the bed, still clad in an oversized white shirt. His smooth, fair legs curled up unconsciously, toes twitching slightly, clearly chilled by the air conditioning.

Doesn’t even know how to take care of himself. Ning Sinian sighed, snuffing out the cigarette before making his way to the boy’s room.

He gathered the scattered picture books and returned them to the bookshelf. Then, reaching under the crook of Wei Xiyan’s legs, he gently adjusted his sleeping posture before pulling the thin blanket over him and raising the room temperature slightly.

The boy murmured something in his sleep, his delicate face pressing into the pillow, rubbing against it in a small, affectionate motion—utterly endearing.

Ning Sinian paused, staring at him for a long moment. Then, he leaned in and whispered beside his ear, "Goodnight, Xiyan… and, I’m sorry."

As he walked away, a faint chuckle echoed in the dimly lit room.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Chapter 2.6
The summer morning sunlight was exceptionally bright. Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, Zhou Yunsheng stretched lazily before freshening up, changing into casual attire, and making his way downstairs.

"Good morning. Did you sleep well last night?" In a rare turn of events, Ning Sinian actually greeted him. Seated beside him, Ning Wangshu also gazed over, eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Good morning. Did getting slapped in the face last night feel good? Zhou Yunsheng sneered internally but outwardly displayed a surprised and flattered expression. He gave the faintest nod, blushed slightly, and quietly took a seat at the farthest end of the table.

Today, Ning Sinian did not rush off to work. Instead, he patiently fed his son porridge while occasionally casting sidelong glances at the teenager who kept his head lowered. Guilt had turned into shyness, gloominess into fragility, and the once-offensive delicate features now appeared refined, obedient, and endearing. No matter how he looked at Wei Xiyan today, Ning Sinian found him irresistibly cute.

This must be the true embodiment of the stolen axe effect.

The realization filled Ning Sinian with shame, his ears burning red. Just then, Zhao Xinfang descended the stairs in a light purple dress, her makeup-free face exuding a gentle, innocent charm.

"Xinfang, last night, Aunt Wang tripped on the stairs while getting water and broke her leg. I need you to visit her at the hospital later." Ning Sinian withdrew his lingering gaze from the teenager and spoke in a warm tone.

"What? She broke her leg? But I didn’t hear a thing!" Zhao Xinfang was startled.

Zhou Yunsheng, an acting master in his own right, also displayed a perfectly timed look of puzzlement.

"She hit her head on the railing when she fell and passed out. It wasn’t until Xiao Li got up to prepare breakfast this morning that she was discovered. You’ll need to visit her frequently these next few months. You know, she practically raised me, and I’ve never treated her as just a housekeeper." Ning Sinian reached out and tucked a stray strand of Zhao Xinfang’s hair behind her ear with an intimate gesture, yet a chilling glint flickered in his dark eyes.

Another award-worthy performance.

Zhao Xinfang had initially been skeptical, but his affectionate tone quickly dispelled her doubts. She nodded obediently, though inwardly, she was seething. Why did that old hag have to fall now of all times? What about my plan? Who's going to carry it out? Did this mean Wei Xiyan would continue lingering under her nose for months? Money Yu frequently visited the Ning residence—if Wei Xiyan encountered him again, there was no telling what suspicions he might develop.

Feeling stifled, she hesitated before speaking. "Sinian, what about the baby?" She shot Wei Xiyan a meaningful glance as she spoke.

Was she subtly urging him to get rid of Wei Xiyan? Ning Sinian sneered inwardly but outwardly sighed in helplessness. "My parents called me yesterday. They’ve hired Dr. Qin Li to help care for the children. She’ll be arriving shortly. Dr. Qin is the head of the Adolescent Mental Health Center and specializes in youth psychology. With her help, they should recover quickly."

So he wasn’t planning to kick Wei Xiyan out? Worse, he even wanted to help him recover? Damn those meddling old fools! Zhao Xinfang fumed but had no choice but to nod in agreement.

As expected, Dr. Qin arrived right after breakfast. She was already in her sixties, spoke in a calm and soothing manner, and had a warm presence that put people at ease—so much so that even Ning Wangshu didn’t resist her.

Ning Sinian had a long discussion with Dr. Qin in his study before finally heading off to work. Meanwhile, Zhao Xinfang, wary of Dr. Qin’s influence, wanted to interfere when she took Ning Wangshu to watch Wei Xiyan paint in the art room. However, she feared arousing suspicion or prompting Dr. Qin to report anything to Ning Sinian. Left with no choice, she begrudgingly picked up her bag and went to the hospital.

Lying in bed with both legs useless, Aunt Wang finally grasped the true ruthlessness of Ning Sinian. She wouldn’t dare leak a single word in front of Zhao Xinfang.

"Xinfang, what an unfortunate time for me to fall! What about Wei Xiyan and Ning Wangshu? Are you going to handle them yourself? That won’t do! Sinian treats me like a godmother, so if I act, he’d never suspect a thing. But you’re different—you’re the stepmother. If you personally harm Wangshu, he’ll inevitably start fearing you, and over time, Sinian will notice. You should wait until I recover and let me take care of it. Now, about the money…"

So it all boiled down to money, as expected. Money can indeed make the world go round, Zhao Xinfang sneered inwardly. Yet, she had to admit Aunt Wang had a point. If she took matters into her own hands, Ning Sinian would catch on eventually. She hadn’t even planned to deal with Ning Wangshu so soon—it was merely a convenient opportunity.

Fine. That little brat could wait until Aunt Wang recovered. For now, she had to figure out how to get rid of Wei Xiyan.

While Zhao Xinfang was scheming, the bond between Zhou Yunsheng and Ning Wangshu was growing stronger by the day.

Dr. Qin proved herself an expert in adolescent psychology. She didn’t pry into their thoughts or deliberately try to get close to them. Instead, she simply encouraged them to spend more time together, letting them discover small joys in life on their own.

Whenever Ning Wangshu clung to Zhou Yunsheng, she would casually settle into a wicker chair under the garden’s shade, basking in the peaceful atmosphere—completely unbothered, uninvolved, and unconcerned.

Even more laid-back than Aunt Wang.

Zhou Yunsheng may have been dragged into playing the villain by the system, but that didn’t mean he was heartless in real life. After countless cycles of tragic demises, he had admittedly developed a few quirks, yet he couldn’t bring himself to be cruel to a child.

Whenever Ning Wangshu clung to his leg, gazing up at him with wide, watery eyes, Zhou Yunsheng could only sigh silently and resign himself to duty. Patiently, he would set up the drawing board, guide Wangshu’s tiny hand, and teach him how to draw straight lines, curves, and circles.

To an adult, these basic exercises might seem dull, yet Ning Wangshu remained remarkably focused, practicing tirelessly. Over time, Zhou Yunsheng realized that the child possessed genuine artistic talent. His attitude shifted, and he began teaching him with a newfound seriousness.

Recently, Ning Sinian had developed a habit—during lunch breaks, he would fixate on his computer screen.

His secretary entered the office with a steaming cup of coffee, only to find him once again absorbed in the display. Not wanting to disturb him, she placed the cup down quietly and tiptoed out.

Displayed on the screen was not stock market data or commodity prices but the figures of one adult and one child.

The slender young man held the small child in his embrace, his large hand gently guiding the child’s tiny fingers across the canvas, smearing colors onto the board. Before them lay two apples and a banana—the subjects of their artistic endeavor.

Gradually, the young man loosened his grip, allowing the child to paint freely, while he took a step back, watching with a gaze full of warmth and quiet attentiveness. After a long moment, he picked up his palette and brush, swiftly blending colors onto the pristine canvas, his eyes occasionally flickering toward the child.

He employed the most ancient painting techniques—at first, only thin washes of color appeared on the canvas, revealing no discernible shapes. Only he knew how stunning the final masterpiece would be. As he immersed himself in the intricate world of artistic creation, the child suddenly tugged at his sleeve.

His hand stiffened for a brief moment, causing the stroke to be heavier than intended. Yet, he did not grow frustrated. Instead, he bent down to admire the child’s doodles, saying nothing, merely ruffling the child’s hair in silent praise. The child pursed his lips, his eyes alight with joy.

They were so peaceful, so serene—radiating a warmth more comforting than the sunlight spilling in from the window. Ning Sinian was utterly entranced, unaware of the tenderness and indulgence reflected in his own expression.

Suddenly, the young man seemed to sense something amiss. He turned his head and gazed directly at the screen.

Ning Sinian froze in his leather chair. It wasn’t until the young man looked away with an indifferent expression that he realized he had been holding his breath.

Did he notice?

Doubt flashed through Ning Sinian’s mind. He was fully aware that his daily act of secretly watching was disturbingly obsessive, yet he couldn’t stop himself. Just now, in that fleeting moment, he had noticed something astonishing—the young man had a pair of stunning peach-blossom eyes. Even without expression, even without words, the mere blink of those eyes as they looked toward him infused his entire being with a luminous vibrancy.

His heart pounded violently twice. Unable to suppress his unease, he lit a cigar, exhaling smoke at the screen. It took him a long while to steady his erratic emotions. And yet, an odd sense of déjà vu crept upon him—almost as if, once upon a time, he had sat here just like this, quietly watching the young man on the other side of the screen, feeling as though time was gentle and the world at peace.

Zhou Yunsheng knew Ning Sinian was still watching him. So, he deliberately locked eyes with the screen—just to startle him. Imagining the man holding his breath in fear of being caught amused him.

After carefully storing Ning Wangshu’s first piece of artwork, Zhou Yunsheng picked up a pencil and sketchbook, taking the child outside for plein air painting.

The studio lay empty for a long time.

Ning Sinian felt an inexplicable emptiness in his heart. He hurriedly pulled up other surveillance feeds, but the two figures were nowhere to be found. Growing anxious, he immediately discarded his cigar and dialed Zhao Jun.

“They’re sketching by the lake. That area is public green space—I haven’t installed any cameras there. If you want to see them, you’ll have to access the neighborhood’s security footage,” Zhao Jun reported while discreetly keeping watch from a distance. “Boss, if I may, Mr. Wei is perfectly sane and has a good temperament. He wouldn’t do anything harmful to Wangshu.”

“All places Xiyan frequents must be under surveillance. I need to see what they’re doing at all times.” Ning Sinian’s voice carried a hint of impatience. After a brief pause, he added, “I don’t doubt Xiyan. He’s… good. I know that.”

He knew his actions were bordering on obsession—covertly monitoring someone, meticulously capturing their every movement, every subtle expression. And yet, he was powerless to stop.

After a moment of silence, Zhao Jun agreed and ended the call.

One second later, the phone rang again.

“Boss? Anything else?”

“I remember your room is linked to the surveillance system as well. You can see Xiyan from there, right?”

“Yes. Do you need me to keep an eye on him at all times?”

“No. Dismantle it immediately. From now on, you are not to monitor Xiyan,” Ning Sinian ordered firmly after a brief hesitation. “No eavesdropping either.”

“…Understood.”

Zhao Jun hung up, quietly marveling at how unpredictable his boss had become.

Chapter 2.7
In the past, Ning Sinian never returned home before midnight. Now, at precisely 5:30 PM, he would pack up his briefcase and leave.

As the hour approached, Qin Li hurriedly called the two children back. Meanwhile, Zhou Yunsheng noticed that the moment he left, Zhao Jun had installed numerous surveillance cameras on the trees by the lake. He couldn’t help but marvel at the man’s sycophantic dedication.

“How was your day?” Ning Sinian, after sending Qin Li off, entered the house, kissed his son’s forehead, then naturally cupped the teenager’s face and kissed him as well, as if such intimacy had always existed between them.

At first, Zhou Yunsheng was taken aback, but over time, he grew accustomed to it. He merely pressed his lips together and gave a slight nod, remaining silent. As if you don’t already know how our day was, you pervert.

Hearing movement, Zhao Xinfang came downstairs and eagerly took Ning Sinian’s suit jacket and briefcase. The two of them exchanged affectionate smiles, their arms wrapped around each other’s waists, resembling a deeply devoted couple.

Except for Ning Wangshu, this entire family was full of award-winning actors.

After dinner, Ning Sinian coaxed his son to sleep and intended to have a conversation with Wei Xiyan to build their rapport. However, he soon realized that the boy had already slipped away and even locked his door.

Had he not been misled and treated the boy so coldly before, Xiyan would never have been this wary of him. Ning Sinian ran a hand through his hair in frustration, deeply regretting his past actions and harboring a simmering resentment toward Zhao Xinfang. But since Qian Yu still had his uses, Ning Sinian had no choice but to bide his time.

The teenager retrieved an art book from the shelf, spread it open on the bed, and sat cross-legged, making notes as he flipped through the pages. Ning Sinian watched him with a soft smile for a moment. Since it was still early, he opened his laptop to handle some work.

Time slipped away unnoticed. At 10:30 PM, his phone let out a faint beep, pulling him from his tasks.

Ning Sinian dismissed the alarm and glanced at the screen. As expected, the boy, who adhered to a precise schedule, was undressing, preparing for a warm shower before bed.

The white shirt slid off his shoulders, revealing the elegant contours of his shoulder blades. His waist was lean yet supple, and his hips were perfectly shaped. With just one glance, Ning Sinian abruptly averted his eyes, suddenly restless.

He stood up, made himself a cup of coffee, and paced the study, listening to the sound of water cascading in the bathroom.

Irritation gnawed at him. He unfastened the top two buttons of his shirt and finally returned to his desk, gripping his coffee cup tightly while forcing himself to focus on the screen.

He had to admit—he anticipated this moment every night. What kind of deviant had he become? He cursed himself inwardly, yet he couldn’t stop.

Setting down the coffee, he lit a cigarette, hoping the smoke would blur his vision. But it was unnecessary—the rising steam from the bathroom had already fogged up the surveillance camera, leaving only a faint silhouette of ivory.

And yet, Ning Sinian found himself dissatisfied again, cursing under his breath.

The water finally stopped. His cigarette had burned down, and he had been so absorbed that the embers nearly scorched his fingers. He let out a string of curses, crushing the cigarette into the ashtray.

The bathroom door opened. The boy emerged, hair damp, wearing only an oversized white shirt that barely covered his thighs. His long, slender legs were fully exposed.

His feet were delicate, perfectly shaped. As he stepped onto the plush wool carpet, his toes curled slightly—a small, unconscious movement that was unbearably endearing.

Years of painting had left his skin porcelain-white, with faint blue veins visible beneath the delicate surface. He looked soft, fragile.

One last time. This is the last time. Tomorrow, he would remove all the cameras.

Ning Sinian reassured himself with this habitual lie, then abandoned all resistance, raising his cup as he indulged in his stolen gaze.

A sharp knock shattered the moment—it was Zhao Jun.

His hands trembled, spilling half his coffee onto his shirt and trousers.

Shit! He shot to his feet, grabbing tissues to clean himself, only to realize the stiffness between his legs.

Shit! He froze, then cursed himself viciously, raking his fingers through his hair. He knew if this continued, he would eventually cross a line he couldn’t return from, yet he was powerless against his own depravity.

“Come in.” He sat down, his face bleak, his tone hollow.

In that brief moment of distraction, the boy on the screen curled his lips into a quick, fleeting smirk, mouthing a silent goodnight—

"Goodnight, pervert."

The two-month summer break passed swiftly. Ning Sinian lived in a constant state of torment, feeling utterly drained.

Maybe I should find a way to distance myself from Wei Xiyan.

He told himself this repeatedly, only to soon contradict his own resolve.

“What are you packing for?” His expression darkened as he saw the boy descending the stairs, dragging a suitcase.

“I’m moving into the school dorms.” Zhou Yunsheng instinctively hid the suitcase behind him, looking somewhat nervous.

Ning Sinian cleared his throat and softened his voice. “How often will you come home?”

“I’ll be back during winter break.”

Winter break? That meant at least three to four months away.

A sharp buzzing filled Ning Sinian’s mind. “Absolutely not. You’re not staying in the dorms.” He had already forgotten his previous resolve to keep his distance.

You’re addicted, aren’t you, you sick pervert? Zhou Yunsheng sneered internally but outwardly widened his eyes in feigned innocence, looking both aggrieved and frightened.

Bathed in the boy’s dewy gaze, Ning Sinian felt his entire body go numb, heat creeping up his ears. But his expression remained stern as he declared, “No. You lack basic self-care skills. Once you start painting, you lose track of time and even forget your meals. You’re staying home—I’ll drive you to and from school every day. Otherwise, I won’t be able to rest easy.”

Zhou Yunsheng sat in the farthest corner, silently staring at the breakfast placed in front of him.

His temper was truly stubborn. Ning Sian had no way to deal with him and could only look at his son, "Baby, your uncle is going to school and won't be back to see you for three or four months. Will you miss him?"

Ning Wangshu finally realized the severity of the situation, immediately jumping off his chair and running over to Zhou Yunsheng. His little hands clung tightly to his pants legs, his face filled with a heart-wrenching expression, as if on the verge of tears.

Such a perverted man, even using his own son. Zhou Yunsheng almost wanted to wipe his face but managed to hold back.

"If you're not staying at school, you'll need to go through the formalities for day school," he said slowly.

"Okay, I'll go take care of it for you in a bit." Ning Sian was finally satisfied, taking the opportunity to sit next to the teenager and happily kissed his son, "Good boy, you're really making your daddy proud."

Zhao Xinfang, who was pretending to cook congee in the kitchen while wearing an apron, heard the commotion and her face darkened. More than two months had passed, and not only had Ning Wangshu started to return to normal, but even Ning Sian's attitude towards Wei Xiyan had drastically changed. When Wei Xiyan first arrived, Ning Sian treated him like air, but now he spoiled him like a treasure.

What was going on? Did he forget how Wei Xiyan treated Ning Wangshu? Or did he know the truth? No, if he knew, how could he be pampering Wang Ma and even taking time out of his day to personally visit the hospital? It must be those two old fools protecting Wei Xiyan, and he had no choice. Now that their relationship was growing closer, what if one day during a conversation, Wei Xiyan revealed what happened at the hotel entrance?

No, I must get rid of Wei Xiyan as soon as possible!

Zhao Xinfang's mind raced, and she thought of a brilliant idea.

Wei Xiyan was a freshman at the Kyoto Academy of Fine Arts. He didn’t take the college entrance exam; instead, Ning's father had a famous oil painter from France write a letter of recommendation, and he was specially recruited.

Ning Sian sent his assistant to take care of the day-school formalities and went to the dorm to help Wei Xiyan pack.

"I'll do it. You stay there," he said as he removed his suit jacket, rolled up his sleeves, and stacked a few large art books, preparing to move them all at once.

As the male lead, Ning Sian's looks were naturally outstanding. He wasn’t as flawless and handsome as Du Xulang, but he exuded a powerful masculinity. Standing almost 190 cm tall, his long legs were always in Zhou Yunsheng's sight, making him dizzy. His thin shirt perfectly outlined his muscular build.

This man was pure, moving testosterone.

Zhou Yunsheng clearly realized this and had to divert his gaze elsewhere.

"Are you hot? Your face is all red. It's so much more comfortable at home with air conditioning." The boy's cheeks were flushed, his eyes shining, making Ning Sian's mouth dry. Taking the chance to speak, he leaned in and pinched the tip of his nose.

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his eyes and nodded, his shy demeanor making Ning Sian itch with desire.

After putting the art books and brushes together in a cardboard box, Ning Sian carried the box with one hand and held the teenager’s hand with the other, walking slowly toward the parking lot.

"Xi Yan, you’re here for the registration?"

As Ning Sian opened the trunk to place the things, Zhou Yunsheng heard someone calling and looked over. His eyes instantly darkened with a wicked smile. He recognized the person—it was Wei Xiyan's senior, Fu Xuan. After leaving the Ning family, Wei Xiyan had a chance to bounce back, but it was ruined by this man. He plagiarized Wei Xiyan's painting and submitted it to the International Oil Painting Awards, winning the top prize and becoming famous.

This incident was the final straw that broke Wei Xiyan.

Zhou Yunsheng squinted his eyes and walked up to him, respectfully greeting, "Senior." Fu Xuan knew he was going for day-school registration and took the opportunity to remind him to show him his competition work if there were any problems, and he could give some suggestions.

Zhou Yunsheng nodded, not saying much. Fu Xuan noticed a man parking his car at the roadside, smoking while staring at him with malicious eyes, and he felt uneasy. He quickly found an excuse to leave.

"Who is he?" Ning Sian asked sternly after they got in the car.

"Senior," Zhou Yunsheng replied, blinking his watery peach blossom eyes.

Ning Sian's sour feelings evaporated, but he still mumbled, "He talks too much."

Zhou Yunsheng, choking on the smoke in the car, couldn't help but frown and said, "Put out the cigarette."

Ning Sian immediately snuffed out the cigarette and raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. His smooth and natural reaction made both of them freeze for a moment.

Zhou Yunsheng stared at him for a while, trying to find any familiar trace on his handsome face but to no avail. The drive back was filled with an awkward silence.


————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Chapter 2.8
Du Xulang was just a string of data written by the main god. Unlike himself, who possessed an immortal soul, how could he possibly follow him here? A man smoking a cigarette was normal, and having similar small habits was also normal.

Zhou Yunsheng convinced himself of this, but a bitter feeling lingered in his heart.

However, he soon had no time to dwell on it, as Fu Xuan called him repeatedly, urging him to submit his painting for the Oil Painting Grand Prize as soon as possible. His tone was filled with an urgency he could hardly conceal.

Fu Xuan was considered a prominent figure in the oil painting department, backed by a powerful family. His father was the president of the C Nation’s Calligraphy and Painting Association, while his mother was an internationally renowned oil painter specializing in landscapes. Her masterpiece Wheat Waves had once been auctioned for a staggering 7.5 million at Jiadeli Auction House. Having inherited his parents' exceptional genes, Fu Xuan held his first solo exhibition at the age of six, and in painting, his talent surpassed everyone else.

However, cases of prodigies falling from grace were not uncommon, and unfortunately, Fu Xuan became a textbook example of this. Having achieved success too early, he grew arrogant. Surrounded by swarms of admirers, he gradually lost his motivation to improve. Instead of honing his skills, he indulged in a life of pleasure.

Artistic skills require constant refinement. Going too long without practice leads to a loss of inspiration and technique. When Fu Xuan realized he could no longer even draw a simple line in front of his canvas, he finally panicked.

But instead of forcing himself to pick up the brush again, he resorted to hiring ghostwriters. Any assignments or competition entries assigned by his instructors were done by others. The oil painting department had no shortage of exceptionally talented yet financially struggling students. Fu Xuan sought out the most discreet among them, offering money in exchange for their work. This arrangement benefited both parties, allowing him to coast smoothly through four years of university and even be regarded as one of the top students by his professors.

However, the International Oil Painting Grand Prize was a major event in the art world, held only once every five years. Even Fu Xuan’s ghostwriter had secured a spot and saw it as a chance to make a name for himself, thus refusing to help him this time.

Left with no choice, Fu Xuan set his sights on Wei Xiyan.

Wei Xiyan was withdrawn and low-key, rarely interacting with his classmates. Naturally, Fu Xuan had no knowledge of his family background and simply assumed he was an orphan with no support. So, he outright plagiarized his painting.

That particular piece had been Wei Xiyan’s outlet after being abandoned by the Ning family. He had poured all his resentment, pain, longing, and sorrow into it, breaking away from his usual steady style and seamlessly blending classical beauty with the free-spirited essence of abstract art. The result was stunning.

With this masterpiece, Wei Xiyan originally had the potential to become one of the greatest oil painters of his time. However, not only did Fu Xuan steal his work, but he also turned around and sued him for copyright infringement.

Having been cast out by the Ning family, Wei Xiyan had no means to fight back and was forced to settle out of court, agreeing to permanently withdraw from the world of oil painting.

The pain of never being able to pick up his beloved brush again was unimaginable, and in the end, Wei Xiyan lost the will to live.

Now, Zhou Yunsheng attended classes as a day student, painting in the studio at the Ning residence rather than alongside his peers. This made it difficult for Fu Xuan to steal his work. As the deadline for submission approached, Fu Xuan grew desperate and called several times, falsely claiming that their professor had asked him to collect everyone’s paintings.

Zhou Yunsheng agreed on the surface, but after hanging up, his gaze darkened.

He carefully studied the painting on his easel, made a few final adjustments, and waited for the paint to dry before bringing it to Ning Sinian’s study.

It was the weekend, and Ning Sinian was working from home. He reviewed thick stacks of documents with focus, but every ten minutes, he would glance at the surveillance feed, feeling reassured each time he saw the boy standing at his easel as usual.

The boy wasn’t going anywhere. He would always stay in place, waiting for him.

The thought struck him suddenly, yet it filled him with deep satisfaction.

When he snapped back to reality, the studio was empty, and a familiar sense of restlessness surged within him. If this were at his office, he would have immediately called Zhao Jun to search for him. But since it was his day off, he decided to go himself.

Just as he set down his documents, a knock came at the door.

“Who is it?” he asked impatiently.

“It’s me.” The boy’s voice was clear and melodious.

Ning Sinian froze for a split second, then quickly shut off the surveillance feed on his computer. He hastily organized the scattered documents on his desk and, upon reaching the door, paused to check his reflection in the glass cabinet, ensuring that he looked impeccably handsome before finally opening the door with a smile.

“Xiyan, come in.”

He naturally took hold of the boy’s pale wrist and led him to the loveseat. At first, he intended to pour a cup of coffee, but for some reason, that didn’t seem appropriate. Instead, he went downstairs to the kitchen and carefully prepared a warm glass of milk, bringing it up with great care.

Zhou Yunsheng was thoroughly enjoying being pampered but kept up an expression of surprise and shyness. His cheeks were flushed, and with his bright, watery peach blossom eyes, he looked so captivating that Ning Sinian nearly lost control.

Suppressing his inner turmoil, Ning Sinian sat close beside him and asked softly, “Xiyan, did you need something?” If not, the boy would never voluntarily come near him.

“Mm.” Zhou Yunsheng timidly glanced at him, pursing his lips before whispering, “I want to participate in the Oil Painting Grand Prize.”

“The Oil Painting Grand Prize? I know about it. Are there no more spots? I’ll make a call right now and get you straight into the finals.” Seizing the chance to do him a favor, Ning Sinian eagerly dialed a number, about to press the call button.

The Ning Corporation was the event’s biggest sponsor—securing a final round entry was effortless.

“No, that’s not it.” Zhou Yunsheng hurriedly grabbed his arm, his face turning bright red. “I already have a spot.”

Taking advantage of the moment, Ning Sinian pulled him into an embrace, gently stroking his soft hair. He barely contained his excitement as he asked, “Then what’s wrong?”

Damn pervert, his tricks for copping a feel are practically divine. Zhou Yunsheng gritted his teeth inwardly but lowered his head and mumbled, “Can I submit this painting?”

Only then did Ning Sinian notice the 22x14 painting frame at his feet. He lifted the protective cover and was greeted by the sight of Ning Wangshu’s chubby little face.

The young child was squatting on the ground, wearing an oversized white shirt with the sleeves rolled up high. He raised his plump little hands, covered in paint, proudly displaying them to the artist. Beside him lay a canvas full of tiny handprints. To him, this was clearly a masterpiece, and his bright, beaming smile reflected his delight—so much so that even the sunlight filtering into the background couldn’t compare.

The artist had poured all their love and tenderness into every brushstroke. Warm tones dominated the canvas, exuding hope, joy, tranquility, and an overwhelming sense of vibrant happiness. The moment the painting was unveiled, it seemed to radiate pure warmth.

Ning Sinian was stunned. He had almost forgotten the last time he saw his son’s smiling face.

“Can I submit this painting for review?” Zhou Yunsheng gently touched his arm.

Ning Sinian finally came back to his senses, blinking his sore eyes. “Yes, of course.” He paused for a moment before adding, “Someday, you should paint a portrait for me too.”

He would never admit that he was even jealous of his own son.

“Okay.” Zhou Yunsheng nodded, carefully covering the painting with a protective sleeve.

When Fu Xuan saw Zhou Yunsheng bringing his work for submission, he looked as if he had found a savior. He studied the painting for a long time, and upon learning that the child in the artwork was purely imaginary, he finally let out a sigh of relief. He knew this painting would stand out—it was incredibly vivid, filled with spirit and emotion, a labor of love poured into every stroke.

The undisguised greed in his eyes told Zhou Yunsheng that he had taken the bait.

By the time he got home, Ning Wangshu was taking his afternoon nap. Zhou Yunsheng tucked him in carefully, kissed his rosy little cheek, and whispered, “I’m sorry for using you. But I will stay by your side and protect you for the rest of my life, until you grow old.”

He tiptoed back to his room, just as Ning Sinian called right on time, interrogating him about his entire day—who he met, what he said, what he did, and so on. His growing possessiveness and controlling nature made Zhou Yunsheng both exasperated and amused.

“Xiyan, Xiyan, are you in there?” A voice called from outside—it was Zhao Xinfang.

Zhou Yunsheng hung up the phone, quickly changed into casual homewear, and opened the door, looking at her silently.

Zhao Xinfang wore light makeup that accentuated her large, bright almond-shaped eyes. Though it was already late autumn, she was dressed in a pure white spaghetti-strap dress. The deliberately lowered neckline failed to conceal the deep valley of her cleavage, and her long, fair legs were positioned suggestively, making her figure appear even more alluring.

Was she trying to seduce him? Trying to drag him into the abyss of adultery as well? Zhou Yunsheng’s eyes flickered slightly.

Noticing the boy’s avoidance of her gaze, Zhao Xinfang felt a surge of satisfaction. She knew men’s weaknesses too well, and her skills were refined—she had even managed to ensnare someone as experienced as Ning Sinian, let alone a naïve boy like Wei Xiyan. Boys like him, orphaned and emotionally closed off, yearned for maternal warmth. All she had to do was flash a few smiles, whisper a few sweet words, and he would obediently fall under her control.

Wei Xiyan’s parents had left him a vast inheritance—though it couldn’t compare to the Ning family’s fortune, it was more than enough for an ordinary person to live in luxury for several lifetimes. Zhao Xinfang had thought long and hard before deciding to make him one of her conquests, someone she could use.

Men, like women, never forget their first time. And she intended to be Wei Xiyan’s first.

“Xiyan, do you need something?” Zhou Yunsheng backed up against the wall, his head slightly tilted toward the bookshelves on his left and above him. Each had a camera installed, capturing the scene in high definition—close-ups included.

Oblivious to this, Zhao Xinfang braced both hands against the wall beside his face, pressing her ample chest against him, her voice soft and sultry. “I’m feeling down and wanted to talk to you for a bit. Your brother is never home, and I get so lonely.”

Zhou Yunsheng took a sharp breath, his cheeks flushing red, before suddenly ducking under her arm in an attempt to escape.

“What are you afraid of? Afraid I’ll eat you?” Zhao Xinfang chuckled and grabbed him back, tilting his chin up as she leaned in for a kiss.

The kiss lasted only two seconds before the violently struggling boy shoved her away. Tears welled up in his eyes as he bolted into the bathroom, retching over the toilet until he was practically dry-heaving bile.

Damn it. This was precisely why he could never like women.

A camera installed in the ceiling quietly recorded everything.

Zhao Xinfang’s face turned pale, then flushed with embarrassment. She had never expected such a reaction. Shouldn’t a normal man have pinned her down and ravished her by now? Her face twisted with humiliation, anger, and—most of all—panic. She stormed to the door and hissed, “Wei Xiyan, if you dare tell Sinian about this, I’ll say you tried to rape me. I’m his wife, and you’re just a nobody with a questionable background. Who do you think he’ll believe?”

The boy stiffened, then curled up by the toilet, trembling as if in fear—or perhaps in silent sobs.

It was only long after Zhao Xinfang left that he slowly raised his head, revealing a deathly pale face and eyes rimmed red.


——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————



Chapter 2.9
The coffee cup brushed past the department head’s face and smashed hard against the office door, producing a loud bang. The shattered porcelain left deep scratches on the expensive furniture. The department head stood frozen in place, stunned. It took him several seconds to finally lift a trembling hand to wipe the cold sweat off his forehead. In a shaky voice, he asked, "B-boss, is there something wrong with the proposal?"

Even if there were issues, there was no reason to be this furious—he looked as if someone had just killed his entire family.

Ning Sinian stared at the computer screen, his face dark as thunder, his chest heaving violently. He was clearly on the verge of exploding.

He cast a cold glance at the department head and waved his hand dismissively. As if granted amnesty, the department head dashed out of the office at once.

On the computer screen, the young man was brushing his teeth. This was already the fifth time, and the foam he spat out was tinged with blood. Ning Sinian could almost taste the metallic bitterness on his own tongue—he was seething with rage.

He wished he could tear Zhao Xinfang apart.

But not yet. He had just thrown out some bait for Qian Yu, who was now on his way to the Ning residence.

He was about to call Zhao Jun to stop the young man—if he kept brushing like this, his gums would start rotting. But just as he picked up the phone, he saw his sleepy-eyed son shuffling toward the young man in oversized slippers.

"Uncle, let's go paint," the boy said, tugging at the young man's pant leg.

Despite feeling miserable, the young man quickly composed himself, spat out the foam, wiped his mouth, and pretended as if nothing had happened. He held the boy’s hand and led him to the art studio. But his mind was clearly elsewhere—he stood in front of the easel for a long time without making a single stroke.

Ning Sinian stared at him, his eyes dry and bloodshot from the intensity of his gaze. He finally squeezed his eyes shut and gritted out a name between clenched teeth—Zhao. Xin. Fang. How dare you?!

With his employer breathing down his neck, Qian Yu was desperate to get his hands on the bidding documents. The moment he stepped into the Ning residence, he was forcefully shoved into the study. The door slammed shut behind him, and a warm body pressed up against his.

Qian Yu was momentarily surprised, but quickly turned the tables, taking full control of the situation. After an intense session on the couch, Zhao Xinfang tried to drag him to the desk for another round, but he refused.

"Why are you so desperate? Ning Sinian not satisfying you?" Qian Yu smirked, adjusting his clothes. "We can't keep going. If we take too long, someone might catch us."

"He hasn't touched me in months," Zhao Xinfang grumbled, her expression dark. "Does he have someone else? Who is it?"

"Never heard anything," Qian Yu said indifferently. "Maybe your charm just wore off."

"So be it. He only married me to bear his child anyway. He might as well have just hired a nanny."

"A nanny wouldn’t be as beautiful as you. Wouldn't have your body. Wouldn't be as wild as you."

Their lips met again, but eventually, they separated. Qian Yu casually adjusted his outfit while swiftly opening the computer and entering the password. With practiced ease, he retrieved the classified documents and copied them onto a flash drive.

"Once this deal is done, I’ll leave the country to lay low. Keep an eye on Ning Sinian for me. Let me know if anything happens," he said, pocketing the drive. Then he grabbed Zhao Xinfang’s chest playfully before hurrying away.

Ning Sinian stood in the messy study, his stomach churning.

The files Qian Yu had just stolen contained critical errors. If he sold them to a rival company, that company would suffer losses worth billions. All Ning Sinian had to do was wait for the right moment to strike and reap the benefits.

He forced himself to return to work, but he couldn't sit still. Every few minutes, he pulled up the surveillance feed to check on the young man.

At last, when the clock struck 5:30, he immediately packed up and left for home.

By the lake, Qin Li was feeding ducks with Ning Wangshu. The young man was nowhere to be seen. Ning Sinian hurriedly greeted them before rushing inside.

"What are you doing?" His voice was sharp, with an unmistakable tremor beneath it.

Zhou Yunsheng paused for a moment, then continued packing his suitcase.

Based on Wei Xiyan’s personality, after what had happened today, he would never dare to tell Ning Sinian, let alone stay in the Ning residence. But Zhou Yunsheng was just putting on a show—he needed to put some pressure on Ning Sinian, forcing him to deal with that woman sooner.

Honestly, Ning Sinian was quite useful. Zhou Yunsheng only needed to blink and pout, and he would take care of everything for him.

"Stop. Right. Now."

Ning Sinian impatiently knocked the clothes out of his hands. But when he saw the young man's startled, wide-eyed expression, he immediately softened. He pulled him into his arms and murmured, "Xiyan, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just... don’t want you to leave. Tell me what happened today."

Zhou Yunsheng shook his head slightly, saying nothing.

Ning Sinian didn’t dare to push him, but his heart felt like it was being fried in boiling oil. He recalled Zhao Xinfang’s forceful kiss, and his eyes gradually turned bloodshot.

Why?

Why can I only watch him from the shadows, while others can touch him at will? Even forcefully steal a kiss from him?

The rage that had been simmering inside him finally exploded. He grasped the young man’s chin and rubbed his thumb harshly over his lips. Over and over again.

Zhou Yunsheng winced at the pain and instinctively tried to turn his head away—only for Ning Sinian to suddenly press in and capture his lips in a searing kiss. His tongue forced its way in, deep and demanding, as if he wanted to devour him whole.

Saliva trickled from the corner of their lips, forming a thin silver thread.

It lasted a long, long time—so long that Zhou Yunsheng could barely breathe. Only then did Ning Sinian reluctantly pull away. He didn’t move far, though; their lips were still touching, his fingers still gripping the young man’s chin as he stared into his eyes. His voice was hoarse and low.

"Tell me how you feel right now. Hmm?"

Like I want to fuck you. Zhou Yunsheng’s eyes gleamed mischievously, but he kept silent.

"Say it. Now."

Ning Sinian’s grip tightened, leaving faint bruises on the pale skin of his chin.

Zhou Yunsheng winced and slowly whispered, "I’m scared." Scared you won’t be able to perform, you crazy bastard.

The man leaned in even closer, his breath hot and intoxicating. His strong presence was overwhelming, nearly dizzying.

Zhou Yunsheng had always loved men like Ning Sinian—domineering, possessive, and wild. His ferocious touch and overwhelming desire were thrilling. Besides, that kiss had been amazing—it completely wiped away the disgust Zhao Xinfang left behind. Honestly, he wanted to thank him for it.

Ning Sinian panted heavily, his voice growing even rougher.

"Besides fear… what else?"

Zhou Yunsheng lowered his gaze, a faint blush rising to his cheeks. His dark eyes shimmered with unshed tears, making them look even more luminous and captivating.

Ning Sinian was entranced. His breath caught in his throat.

He’s shy.

He doesn’t find me disgusting. He… he feels something for me too.

Realizing this, it was as if he had finally found salvation after clinging to the edge of a cliff for so long. Relief and exhilaration surged through him. His tense nerves loosened, his sharp features softened, and his gaze overflowed with deep, boundless love.

"Xiyan… Xiyan… Xiyan…"

He murmured the young man’s name over and over, showering him with delicate kisses.

"Xiyan, baby, I love you. I love you so much. Can you understand? Can you feel it?"

The relationship with Ning Sinian naturally fell into place. No matter what changes might occur after the female lead appeared, Zhou Yunsheng didn’t care. He lived only in the present, cherishing this moment.

A month later, the Kyoto Academy of Fine Arts received news that out of the five paintings submitted for competition, one had made it to the final round and was now eligible to compete for the highest award. In such an esteemed art event, even the slightest association was like being gilded with gold, let alone having one’s work judged by master artists from around the world. It was an unparalleled honor.

The notification letter not only contained the selected artist’s name but also included a photograph of the painting. Students from the oil painting department eagerly passed it around.

"This is my painting. Why is it signed under Senior Brother’s name?" Zhou Yunsheng's face turned pale.

Everyone fell silent. Their shared mentor, Professor Tang Weiming, cast a severe gaze at him. "This painting was clearly created by Fu Xuan. I watched him complete it stroke by stroke. Why are you claiming it’s yours? Do you have any proof?"

Tang Weiming certainly knew who the real artist was. But having accepted benefits from Fu Xuan, he could only betray Wei Xiyan. The art world was not as pure and untainted as outsiders imagined—something Wei Xiyan would have to learn sooner or later.

"Yeah, we share the same studio with Senior Brother Fu Xuan. We saw him paint it with our own eyes." Several students chimed in, obviously having been bribed by Fu Xuan in advance.

Fu Xuan retrieved the notification letter, patted Zhou Yunsheng’s shoulder, and chuckled. "Junior Brother, you need evidence before making accusations. Otherwise, I could sue you for defamation."

Zhou Yunsheng seemed intimidated by the threat. His complexion was ashen, almost translucent. He cast a steady gaze at Tang Weiming, watching as the professor awkwardly averted his eyes. Then he looked at the classmates who had given false testimony before finally turning and walking away, step by step.

Fu Xuan let out a sigh of relief, knowing that as an orphan, Zhou Yunsheng had no power to fight back. He cheerfully announced that he would treat everyone to a meal. The students erupted in excitement, laughing and jostling as they made their way toward the school gate.

Zhou Yunsheng walked to a secluded corner, rubbed his eyes, cleared his throat, and then made a phone call.

His voice, thick with nasal congestion, startled Ning Sinian. Alarmed, he immediately asked, "Baby, what’s wrong? Did something happen? Don’t be afraid, I’m here. Tell me where you are, I’ll come right away."

Zhou Yunsheng’s hoarse voice came through the phone, "I’m at school. I feel terrible right now."

Ning Sinian comforted him while rushing downstairs to get his car. By the time he hung up, he was already on his way.

Zhou Yunsheng had the ability to deal with Fu Xuan, but right now, he was Wei Xiyan. Wei Xiyan’s world consisted only of painting—none of this filth. From the beginning, he had intended to let Ning Sinian handle all his troubles. After all, this was a debt Ning Sinian owed to Wei Xiyan—one that would have to be repaid sooner or later. As for Ning Sinian’s growing feelings for him, that was purely an accident.

Poor Fu Xuan had no idea what kind of terrifying person he had provoked.

Chapter 2.10
Seeing the young man hiding in a corner, eyes red from tears, Ning Sinian was so furious he wanted to kill someone. He barely suppressed his anxiety, gently coaxing and persuading him to tell the truth before immediately taking him to the principal's office to file a complaint.

The principal dared not neglect the matter and quickly called Fu Xuan, Tang Weiming, and the others to his office.

When the group entered, their expressions haughty, Zhou Yunsheng pretended to be afraid, shrinking into Ning Sinian’s embrace and secretly clutching the corner of his coat. This small action only fueled Ning Sinian’s anger further, yet he still held him gently, patting his back reassuringly and whispering, “Don’t be scared.”

Tang Weiming and the others naturally recognized Ning Sinian’s face, which frequently graced the front pages of financial magazines. Seeing the intimate interaction between the two, a bad premonition rose in their hearts.

Ning Sinian wasted no time on pleasantries. Taking out his phone, he said, “I personally witnessed Xiyan painting the artwork ‘Brilliance’ stroke by stroke, yet for some reason, it is signed with Fu Xuan’s name. I’m here today to clarify this matter. To avoid any future misunderstandings, may I record our conversation?”

Refusing would be an admission of guilt. Fu Xuan had already coordinated with his mentor and classmates, so he thought recording wouldn't be a big deal. He nodded in agreement.

Tang Weiming, trembling, asked, “Mr. Ning, may I ask what your relationship with Wei Xiyan is?”

“What does my relationship with Xiyan have to do with you?” Ning Sinian sneered and turned to Fu Xuan, “When and where did you complete this painting? Who is the person in the painting?”

“I started painting in early September and finished by the end of October. I worked in the school studio the entire time, and my fellow students who share the studio can attest to this. The person in the painting doesn’t exist in reality—I imagined what my future child might look like, whether they’d inherit my artistic talent. With hope and love in my heart, I painted this child's face, stroke by stroke…”

Feeling guilty, Fu Xuan kept talking, rambling about his so-called artistic inspiration. The classmates he had bribed nodded in agreement, and even Tang Weiming added a few words to support him.

However, Zhou Yunsheng had actually started painting in mid-July and finished by the end of September. The entire painting process was recorded on Ning Sinian’s security cameras. Moreover, he had painted Ning Wangshu—one charge of image rights infringement alone was enough to ruin Fu Xuan.

Now, because of his own guilty conscience, Fu Xuan was speaking too much and making too many mistakes, all of which Ning Sinian recorded. Even if he wanted to retract his statements later, it would be impossible. He was walking himself straight into a dead end.

Ning Sinian didn’t interrupt him. Once he finished speaking, Ning proceeded to ask Tang Weiming a few questions, collecting solid evidence. Then, he took the young man’s hand, nodded at the principal, and said, “Principal Li, I’ll be taking my leave. My lawyers will handle this matter. I trust your school will ensure such incidents do not happen again in the future.”

“Of course, of course, Mr. Ning, please take care.” The principal respectfully escorted them to the door. Then, he turned back to stare at Fu Xuan for a long while before shaking his head. “Go home and ask your parents to hire the best lawyer they can find. If you're lucky, you might be able to negotiate a settlement.”

“Principal, why should I negotiate a settlement? That painting is mine! So many people can testify for me!” Fu Xuan refused to back down.

“Yours? So you painted Ning Sinian’s son from thousands of miles away? Imagining your future child while painting… Even I feel embarrassed for you.”

As soon as the principal finished speaking, Tang Weiming, who had been uneasy all along, felt his vision darken. The students who had given false testimony broke out in cold sweats, while Fu Xuan shrieked in disbelief. “How could this happen? Wei Xiyan told me that child was imaginary!”

The principal sighed internally—so it was true. Without hesitation, he threw them out of the office. Everyone involved in today’s fiasco was done for; their future was ruined.

Back home, Fu Xuan had no choice but to confess everything to his parents. But his family's influence was nothing compared to the Ning financial empire. Though the trial wasn’t public, and the media didn’t report on it to protect Ning Wangshu, the Fu family’s reputation in the art world was completely destroyed. After paying a huge compensation, they fled overseas, never to be heard from again.

As for Tang Weiming and the students who had given false testimony, they were also forced out of the oil painting circle, living out the rest of their lives in obscurity.

On the way home, Zhou Yunsheng hesitantly asked, “He had so many witnesses, but we only had the baby. Could we lose the case?”

“How could we? Our evidence is solid,” Ning Sinian reassured him, ruffling his soft hair.

“What evidence?” Zhou Yunsheng blinked innocently.

Ning Sinian broke out in a cold sweat but smiled. “Don’t worry. If I say we have evidence, we have evidence. You don’t need to concern yourself with the trial—I’ll handle everything. Do you have any other paintings? If so, pick one, and I’ll submit it to the competition for you.”

Zhou Yunsheng, satisfied with Ning Sinian’s nervous expression, nodded. “I have another painting of similar quality to ‘Brilliance.’ You can submit that one. By the way, can we avoid a public trial? I don’t want the baby’s life to be affected.”

The media would undoubtedly dig into the painting’s backstory, exposing Ning Wangshu to public scrutiny. He was still so young—such attention wouldn’t be good for him. Even though Zhou Yunsheng had the absolute ability to protect him, he still felt guilty for using his image.

Ning Sinian, unaware of the truth, only saw how much Zhou Yunsheng cared for his son, as if he were his own child. His heart softened, and he pulled him close, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead.

The two exchanged smiles, their eyes full of warmth.

When they got home, Zhou Yunsheng took Ning Wangshu to the lakeside to paint, while Ning Sinian called the Ning Corporation’s legal team. A civil case like this was child’s play for the country’s top law firm, and they promised to make the defendant pay the highest price.

After hanging up, Ning Sinian lit a cigar and stood by the window, gazing at the pair painting together. Just then, Zhao Xinfang stormed in, holding a credit card.

“Sinian, why are all my credit cards frozen?”

Ning Sinian turned around, his tone exceptionally gentle. “Xinfang, come take a look at this.”

Zhao Xinfang walked over and bent down to look at the computer screen. Ning Sinian clicked the play button, and in an instant, the room was filled with moans and gasps. Two pale bodies were intertwined in various acrobatic positions, the scene overwhelmingly decadent.

The color drained from Zhao Xinfang’s face. Staggering back a few steps, she stammered, “Sinian, I didn’t mean to... No, I was forced... Sinian, please don’t—”

Ning Sinian ignored her and picked up his phone to make a call.

About ten minutes later, several police officers knocked on the door and entered. They arrested Zhao Xinfang on charges of fraud, theft, and misappropriation of trade secrets. Given the enormous amount of money involved, she was sentenced to the maximum penalty and was ordered to pay an astronomical sum in compensation to the Ning Corporation. Additionally, the judge ruled to dissolve their marriage.

As for Qian Yu, he had already taken his own life a month earlier out of guilt.

Three years later, Dr. Qin Li retired, and Ning Sinian decided to hire a new housekeeper to take care of his partner and child. After all, both of them were obsessed with painting—once they stepped into the studio, they forgot everything else. Without someone to keep an eye on them, they might just starve themselves to death.

This was also why Ning Sinian refused to remove the surveillance cameras in the house.

That day, a beautiful young girl knocked on the door of the Ning residence.

“A-Ah! You... You’re Wei Xiyan? Wei Xiyan from The Way Home?” The girl pointed at the handsome young man’s face and exclaimed.

The Way Home was a painting submitted to an oil painting competition three years ago by Zhou Yunsheng as a gift to Wei Xiyan. It depicted a weary-looking boy lying on a woman’s lap. One of her hands gently combed through his hair, while the other cupped his face. Surrounding them were blooming roses, the breeze swirling around them, creating a warm and bright scene. Yet, behind the boy stretched an endless path of thorns.

His legs were curled up, his feet covered in blood, making it easy to imagine the arduous journey he had endured to reach the woman’s side. The painting, though surrealist in nature, carried a touch of classical romanticism, using warm hues to tell a heartbreaking story. The boy lay there quietly, his face so serene and beautiful that every passerby felt compelled to check his breathing—to see if he was still alive.

He was so young; he shouldn’t have had to bear everything alone. Everyone who saw the painting felt the urge to become the hands that embraced him.

When the painting was exhibited, so many people leaned in to check the boy’s breath that, to prevent damage, the organizers had to put up a sign next to it that read: He’s still alive!

The artist’s exceptional skill and raw emotion breathed life into the piece, winning it the highest award in the oil painting competition that year.

Wei Xiyan became an overnight sensation, but Ning Sinian was haunted by nightmares for months. Although the organizers reassured everyone that he’s still alive, only Ning Sinian understood the truth—the woman embracing the boy was actually his mother. His longing to be held in her arms was no different from longing to embrace death. The painting was a veiled expression of his suicidal thoughts.

Terrified, Ning Sinian tightened his control over the young man. If Wei Xiyan disappeared from his sight for more than three minutes, cold sweat would bead on his forehead, and he would become extremely anxious.

Zhao Jun, who was frequently ordered to go find him, often grumbled to himself that his boss was seriously ill.

At this moment, Ning Sinian’s face was dark as he stared at the screen, watching the man and woman interact harmoniously. The phone pressed against his ear creaked under his tightening grip.

“Can you bake cookies? My nephew loves them,” Zhou Yunsheng asked, looking at the young woman. Yes, this was the long-awaited female lead.

“I can! Would you like me to bake some for you and the child right now?” The girl’s cheeks flushed slightly, and her eyes sparkled. Because of The Way Home, she had fallen in love with Wei Xiyan three years ago. She never expected that he would be her future employer.

“Sure. The kitchen has everything you need—just help yourself,” Zhou Yunsheng gestured toward the cabinets.

The girl eagerly nodded and was just about to put on an apron when Zhao Jun strode in and said in a deep voice, “Mr. Wei, the boss just called. He said the housekeeper has already been hired, so you don’t need to worry about it. You can continue painting—I’ll escort this young lady out.” Without waiting for a response, he firmly led the girl out of the Ning residence.

Not long after, a new housekeeper arrived at the Ning residence—an elderly woman of sixty-five, her face wrinkled like dried orange peel.

Zhou Yunsheng scrutinized her from head to toe, cursing pervert in his mind but letting a smirk slip onto his lips.
